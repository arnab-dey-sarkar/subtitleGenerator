1
0:00:30 --> 0:00:50
There's something wrong with me.

2
0:00:54 --> 0:00:56
An emptiness.

3
0:00:56 --> 0:01:06
I thought it started a misunderstanding, but now it feels like something bigger.

4
0:01:06 --> 0:01:10
Just a...

5
0:01:10 --> 0:01:14
...hold it.

6
0:01:20 --> 0:01:24
Or maybe I'm just bored.

7
0:01:26 --> 0:01:28
Myาง has stopped me from learning.

8
0:01:28 --> 0:01:30
But I'm not tired about it.

9
0:01:30 --> 0:01:33
What will we learn if I keep it...?

10
0:01:42 --> 0:01:44
No!

11
0:01:46 --> 0:01:49
You know what?

12
0:01:49 --> 0:01:52
Play awstably not playing the whole game?

13
0:01:52 --> 0:01:54
It has to make things really...

14
0:01:54 --> 0:02:01
I will clean up this mess.

15
0:02:01 --> 0:02:08
Next week, Malaysia and New York are awesome.

16
0:02:08 --> 0:02:13
I thought to try myself into work, do the answer.

17
0:02:13 --> 0:02:17
I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm the end of the purpose,

18
0:02:17 --> 0:02:24
and the fact that I'm just bursting from wind.

19
0:02:24 --> 0:02:29
Or like an old leaf.

20
0:02:29 --> 0:02:32
Or like an old leaf.

21
0:02:32 --> 0:02:34
And I read what you think is better.

22
0:02:34 --> 0:02:35
Hey!

23
0:02:35 --> 0:02:37
You're what's listening to me.

24
0:02:37 --> 0:02:40
It's like your mind is somewhere else.

25
0:02:40 --> 0:02:43
Well, whatever, your useless thing is.

26
0:02:43 --> 0:02:46
You can get me past that facial recognition.

27
0:02:46 --> 0:02:48
Hello?

28
0:02:48 --> 0:02:52
Can you help me get a neck?

29
0:02:52 --> 0:02:53
No.

30
0:02:53 --> 0:02:57
I mean, that's from the problem, I guess.

31
0:02:57 --> 0:03:01
Well, I didn't say I had to destroy the evidence in Asalu.

32
0:03:01 --> 0:03:03
It's because I get messy.

33
0:03:03 --> 0:03:04
Stop right there!

34
0:03:05 --> 0:03:06
Hi!

35
0:03:06 --> 0:03:09
Now let's have a say that I could open a scanner.

36
0:03:09 --> 0:03:11
To download this, can you?

37
0:03:11 --> 0:03:13
This research is probably an ox school.

38
0:03:13 --> 0:03:15
You're going to tell me how I got this.

39
0:03:15 --> 0:03:18
We made it.

40
0:03:18 --> 0:03:20
And I made it.

41
0:03:20 --> 0:03:21
I made it.

42
0:03:21 --> 0:03:22
I made it.

43
0:03:22 --> 0:03:23
I made it.

44
0:03:23 --> 0:03:24
I made it.

45
0:03:24 --> 0:03:25
I made it.

46
0:03:25 --> 0:03:26
I made it.

47
0:03:26 --> 0:03:27
I made it.

48
0:03:27 --> 0:03:28
I made it.

49
0:03:28 --> 0:03:29
I made it.

50
0:03:29 --> 0:03:30
I made it.

51
0:03:30 --> 0:03:31
I made it.

52
0:03:31 --> 0:03:32
I made it.

53
0:03:32 --> 0:03:33
I made it.

54
0:03:33 --> 0:03:34
I made it.

55
0:03:34 --> 0:03:36
I made the answer.

56
0:03:36 --> 0:03:37
I made it.

57
0:03:37 --> 0:03:38
I made it.

58
0:03:38 --> 0:03:39
I made it.

59
0:03:39 --> 0:03:40
It was a broadcast.

60
0:03:40 --> 0:03:41
Continue.

61
0:03:41 --> 0:03:42
Let me hear it.

62
0:03:42 --> 0:03:45
Look, I saw Italian investigation.

63
0:03:45 --> 0:03:47
I was going to drive all this stuff.

64
0:03:47 --> 0:03:58
Everybody calls me counting orders and they make the coffee.

65
0:03:58 --> 0:03:59,4800
Oh, it's so pale.

66
0:03:59,4800 --> 0:04:00,4800
This is completely unquad sambi!

67
0:04:00,4800 --> 0:04:01,4800
Oh, my god.

68
0:04:01,4800 --> 0:04:06,4800
You're shocked, I don't.

69
0:04:06,4800 --> 0:04:08,4800
No, I'm not.

70
0:04:08,4800 --> 0:04:11,4800
How positive is she, man?

71
0:04:11,4800 --> 0:04:12,4800
The state.

72
0:04:12,4800 --> 0:04:16,4800
The West is in the air.

73
0:04:16,4800 --> 0:04:23,4800
Yes, you let her down in here.

74
0:04:23,4800 --> 0:04:27,4800
You tried to save her last one.

75
0:04:27,4800 --> 0:04:30,4800
She's a century, isn't she?

76
0:04:30,4800 --> 0:04:33,4800
She's a whole city.

77
0:04:33,4800 --> 0:04:38,4800
Oh, no.

78
0:04:38,4800 --> 0:04:40,4800
Oh, then.

79
0:04:40,4800 --> 0:04:44,4800
I need to get fit.

80
0:04:44,4800 --> 0:04:52,4800
Okay, Simon, just go away from her.

81
0:04:52,4800 --> 0:04:55,4800
Simon, just go get it.

82
0:04:55,4800 --> 0:04:58,4800
What's next?

83
0:05:05,4800 --> 0:05:06,4800
Have you said regards?

84
0:05:06,4800 --> 0:05:09,4800
Is the freshman congressman any words on today's hearing?

85
0:05:09,4800 --> 0:05:16,4800
Well, I'm not on the impeachment committee, but the rumors, wrongdoing are very worried.

86
0:05:16,4800 --> 0:05:21,4800
They are very, very concerning and worrying.

87
0:05:21,4800 --> 0:05:24,4800
I think that my broken-knit constituents deserve higher.

88
0:05:24,4800 --> 0:05:28,4800
So we're going to get to the bottom of this...

89
0:05:28,4800 --> 0:05:31,4800
...orignation.

90
0:05:31,4800 --> 0:05:34,4800
Thank you.

91
0:05:34,4800 --> 0:05:39,4800
The video is meeting to examine the sufficient will sit before you.

92
0:05:39,4800 --> 0:05:42,4800
Particles of impeachment have been brought against.

93
0:05:42,4800 --> 0:05:45,4800
And when we've all been favored,

94
0:05:45,4800 --> 0:05:48,4800
the impeachment seat will be removed from her post-prone.

95
0:05:48,4800 --> 0:05:51,4800
Please, stay united for the record.

96
0:05:51,4800 --> 0:05:55,4800
Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.

97
0:05:55,4800 --> 0:05:57,4800
Miss Fontaine.

98
0:05:57,4800 --> 0:05:59,4800
No, it's de Fontaine.

99
0:05:59,4800 --> 0:06:00,4800
You forgot to do it.

100
0:06:00,4800 --> 0:06:04,4800
Mr. Anderson, for example, is Secretary of Defense?

101
0:06:04,4800 --> 0:06:08,4800
Not Secretary of Chance.

102
0:06:08,4800 --> 0:06:11,4800
It is de Fontaine.

103
0:06:11,4800 --> 0:06:14,4800
At this moment, you are serving as a director of the CIA.

104
0:06:14,4800 --> 0:06:16,4800
That is correct.

105
0:06:16,4800 --> 0:06:19,4800
And for that, you were the chairwoman of the board of Ox Group.

106
0:06:19,4800 --> 0:06:24,4800
Yes, although I have fully divested in Ox and is taking office,

107
0:06:24,4800 --> 0:06:28,4800
I now sit on the board in a strategic guidance capacity.

108
0:06:28,4800 --> 0:06:34,4800
Following this strategic guidance, the Ox Group maintains significant holdings

109
0:06:34,4800 --> 0:06:39,4800
in unregulated labs in foreign countries and rumored human experimentation.

110
0:06:39,4800 --> 0:06:47,4800
All parts of illegal operation to develop your own super person.

111
0:06:47,4800 --> 0:06:50,4800
May I speak now, Congressman?

112
0:06:50,4800 --> 0:06:51,4800
Yes.

113
0:06:51,4800 --> 0:06:56,4800
First of all, I don't have time to entertain these rumors and this gossip.

114
0:06:56,4800 --> 0:07:00,4800
Right now, there are multiple rogue nations with technologies

115
0:07:00,4800 --> 0:07:02,4800
that far exceed our own.

116
0:07:02,4800 --> 0:07:06,4800
And you'll recall that our last president turned into a bright red,

117
0:07:06,4800 --> 0:07:13,4800
superhuman monster who nearly destroyed this city.

118
0:07:13,4800 --> 0:07:17,4800
The Avengers are not walking through that door.

119
0:07:17,4800 --> 0:07:20,4800
We have no programmable heroes.

120
0:07:20,4800 --> 0:07:25,4800
That is why the Onus is only on us, the American government,

121
0:07:25,4800 --> 0:07:28,4800
to shield its citizens.

122
0:07:28,4800 --> 0:07:33,4800
And you know, anything I have done in my role as the head of Ox,

123
0:07:33,4800 --> 0:07:37,4800
the CIA has been done with back goal in Monk.

124
0:07:37,4800 --> 0:07:39,4800
Ordering out of directive.

125
0:07:39,4800 --> 0:07:42,4800
I officially reject these articles of impeachment.

126
0:07:42,4800 --> 0:07:46,4800
This is a partisan waste of time and your HUD will come up empty.

127
0:07:46,4800 --> 0:07:51,4800
No matter how many nooks and crannies you happen to stick your nose in.

128
0:07:51,4800 --> 0:07:55,4800
So you don't mind if this committee continues this investigation?

129
0:07:55,4800 --> 0:07:58,4800
Of course not.

130
0:07:58,4800 --> 0:08:00,4800
Shh.

131
0:08:00,4800 --> 0:08:02,4800
Gotta get all of this out of here, based out.

132
0:08:02,4800 --> 0:08:04,4800
Yep, so far they've removed all the case stuff.

133
0:08:04,4800 --> 0:08:07,4800
You just get rid of any timing chance that you get me impeached

134
0:08:07,4800 --> 0:08:09,4800
from random and federal president.

135
0:08:09,4800 --> 0:08:11,4800
Copy, no prison.

136
0:08:11,4800 --> 0:08:13,4800
What about our shadow box out in the field?

137
0:08:13,4800 --> 0:08:15,4800
And all those who sense get tied up?

138
0:08:15,4800 --> 0:08:18,4800
Well, the entertain, yes, but the rope is off-lier.

139
0:08:18,4800 --> 0:08:21,4800
What? Can you please just set more?

140
0:08:21,4800 --> 0:08:22,4800
Okay.

141
0:08:22,4800 --> 0:08:27,4800
And one upper lip will open entire laboratory and it will fall apart forever.

142
0:08:27,4800 --> 0:08:29,4800
Did the newest signance get sent out this mail?

143
0:08:29,4800 --> 0:08:30,4800
Yes, ma'am.

144
0:08:30,4800 --> 0:08:32,4800
All but one has checked it.

145
0:08:32,4800 --> 0:08:35,4800
Where is she?

146
0:08:35,4800 --> 0:08:36,4800
Okay.

147
0:08:36,4800 --> 0:08:38,4800
Just a minute.

148
0:08:38,4800 --> 0:08:40,4800
Wait, wait a minute.

149
0:08:40,4800 --> 0:08:43,4800
Let's get the phone away.

150
0:08:43,4800 --> 0:08:47,4800
I click leave on board.

151
0:08:47,4800 --> 0:08:54,4800
Your support units will be rewarded with Doresh HQ.

152
0:08:54,4800 --> 0:08:59,4800
Do you know?

153
0:08:59,4800 --> 0:09:07,4800
Am I doing it?

154
0:09:09,4800 --> 0:09:18,4800
No, thank you.

155
0:09:18,4800 --> 0:09:23,4800
Isn't it an unnatural warning evening?

156
0:09:23,4800 --> 0:09:27,4800
You let me talk to you.

157
0:09:27,4800 --> 0:09:29,4800
Hi, Dan.

158
0:09:29,4800 --> 0:09:31,4800
Sorry for the wait.

159
0:09:31,4800 --> 0:09:33,4800
I was so important call.

160
0:09:33,4800 --> 0:09:35,4800
I'd be classed by...

161
0:09:35,4800 --> 0:09:37,4800
How was it, Dan?

162
0:09:37,4800 --> 0:09:39,4800
A year.

163
0:09:39,4800 --> 0:09:41,4800
Well, yeah, I guess...

164
0:09:41,4800 --> 0:09:43,4800
I guess it has been...

165
0:09:43,4800 --> 0:09:47,4800
You've been dizzy with Lark?

166
0:09:47,4800 --> 0:09:49,4800
Oh, yeah.

167
0:09:49,4800 --> 0:09:51,4800
Yeah, I loved the...

168
0:09:51,4800 --> 0:09:53,4800
I worked.

169
0:09:53,4800 --> 0:09:57,4800
We took too many eyes and fire, security,

170
0:09:57,4800 --> 0:09:59,4800
remote business,

171
0:09:59,4800 --> 0:10:03,4800
you know, the important people that made the right.

172
0:10:03,4800 --> 0:10:05,4800
So you...

173
0:10:05,4800 --> 0:10:07,4800
You feel fulfilled?

174
0:10:07,4800 --> 0:10:09,4800
Oh, yeah.

175
0:10:09,4800 --> 0:10:11,4800
Yeah, so fulfilled.

176
0:10:11,4800 --> 0:10:13,4800
Who should you see the best to arrive back?

177
0:10:13,4800 --> 0:10:15,4800
Isn't this taken with you, Goldfish?

178
0:10:15,4800 --> 0:10:17,4800
No, Goldmarshtard next block of...

179
0:10:17,4800 --> 0:10:19,4800
I'm not...

180
0:10:19,4800 --> 0:10:21,4800
The point is, this...

181
0:10:21,4800 --> 0:10:23,4800
What brings you here?

182
0:10:23,4800 --> 0:10:25,4800
I...

183
0:10:25,4800 --> 0:10:27,4800
I wanted to talk to you about Valentino.

184
0:10:27,4800 --> 0:10:29,4800
Okay.

185
0:10:29,4800 --> 0:10:31,4800
No assignments.

186
0:10:31,4800 --> 0:10:33,4800
You come to the...

187
0:10:33,4800 --> 0:10:35,4800
Go to the end, you want to know...

188
0:10:35,4800 --> 0:10:37,4800
I...

189
0:10:37,4800 --> 0:10:39,4800
I think I'm gonna quit.

190
0:10:39,4800 --> 0:10:41,4800
I would burn the city to the ground to earth.

191
0:10:41,4800 --> 0:10:43,4800
What?

192
0:10:43,4800 --> 0:10:45,4800
I just said you were fulfilled.

193
0:10:45,4800 --> 0:10:47,4800
Look around. I miss you.

194
0:10:47,4800 --> 0:10:49,4800
Give me her number.

195
0:10:49,4800 --> 0:10:51,4800
No way!

196
0:10:51,4800 --> 0:10:53,4800
Let's just stop.

197
0:10:53,4800 --> 0:10:55,4800
Lena!

198
0:10:55,4800 --> 0:10:57,4800
Lena, what is wrong?

199
0:10:57,4800 --> 0:11:01,4800
I'm like, inside you didn't even waste in your pants now.

200
0:11:01,4800 --> 0:11:05,4800
I've just been wondering, you know, like, what...

201
0:11:05,4800 --> 0:11:09,4800
Is the point...

202
0:11:09,4800 --> 0:11:11,4800
And then you dis.

203
0:11:11,4800 --> 0:11:13,4800
The point of work is, fam, it's fortune.

204
0:11:13,4800 --> 0:11:17,4800
Fortune by strands and love.

205
0:11:17,4800 --> 0:11:19,4800
A lot of cool gloves.

206
0:11:19,4800 --> 0:11:21,4800
Okay.

207
0:11:21,4800 --> 0:11:23,4800
Well, I know.

208
0:11:23,4800 --> 0:11:25,4800
You want to know when I was really good?

209
0:11:25,4800 --> 0:11:27,4800
Yes, please.

210
0:11:29,4800 --> 0:11:31,4800
I was certain my country...

211
0:11:31,4800 --> 0:11:33,4800
is a hero.

212
0:11:33,4800 --> 0:11:37,4800
I said it's a Williams in the streets.

213
0:11:37,4800 --> 0:11:39,4800
It's shit under the crowd.

214
0:11:39,4800 --> 0:11:43,4800
A door like a God...

215
0:11:43,4800 --> 0:11:45,4800
never ends.

216
0:11:45,4800 --> 0:11:47,4800
There is no higher God name.

217
0:11:51,4800 --> 0:11:55,4800
You're just as though I'm just seeing something happen.

218
0:11:55,4800 --> 0:11:59,4800
You're just as though you're falling in her blood.

219
0:12:01,4800 --> 0:12:03,4800
I didn't mean to.

220
0:12:03,4800 --> 0:12:05,4800
You're so bad.

221
0:12:05,4800 --> 0:12:07,4800
You're in.

222
0:12:07,4800 --> 0:12:09,4800
You're too big for me.

223
0:12:09,4800 --> 0:12:13,4800
You know, I just do so to you.

224
0:12:13,4800 --> 0:12:15,4800
It's a cry.

225
0:12:15,4800 --> 0:12:17,4800
You can put it in a good word, Lena.

226
0:12:17,4800 --> 0:12:19,4800
I'll let you know.

227
0:12:19,4800 --> 0:12:23,4800
Okay, well, reporting good evening to you.

228
0:12:23,4800 --> 0:12:25,4800
What's my next assignment?

229
0:12:25,4800 --> 0:12:27,4800
Thank you.

230
0:12:27,4800 --> 0:12:29,4800
Miss Belayba, I'm starting to worry.

231
0:12:29,4800 --> 0:12:31,4800
I should just know I...

232
0:12:31,4800 --> 0:12:33,4800
I need a change.

233
0:12:33,4800 --> 0:12:35,4800
Oh, really?

234
0:12:35,4800 --> 0:12:37,4800
Yeah, maybe something more...

235
0:12:37,4800 --> 0:12:39,4800
public-facing?

236
0:12:39,4800 --> 0:12:41,4800
Interesting.

237
0:12:41,4800 --> 0:12:43,4800
You know, I was ready for her class hat.

238
0:12:43,4800 --> 0:12:47,4800
Yeah, this just isn't working for me anymore.

239
0:12:47,4800 --> 0:12:51,4800
Okay, well, you know, I love promoting women.

240
0:12:51,4800 --> 0:12:53,4800
You complete this last class.

241
0:12:53,4800 --> 0:12:55,4800
I'm going to be a little bit more...

242
0:12:55,4800 --> 0:12:59,4800
You complete this last assignment for Oxen.

243
0:12:59,4800 --> 0:13:01,4800
You have a deal?

244
0:13:01,4800 --> 0:13:03,4800
Okay.

245
0:13:03,4800 --> 0:13:05,4800
Okay.

246
0:13:05,4800 --> 0:13:09,4800
There's the warehouse facility involved.

247
0:13:09,4800 --> 0:13:11,4800
Built a bottle down into an bathroom.

248
0:13:11,4800 --> 0:13:15,4800
It stores all of Ox Group's most sensitive assets.

249
0:13:15,4800 --> 0:13:19,4800
And towns come in that are rogue-occurated with attributes.

250
0:13:19,4800 --> 0:13:21,4800
Perfectly disparate your off.

251
0:13:21,4800 --> 0:13:23,4800
Me is intending to...

252
0:13:23,4800 --> 0:13:25,4800
Well, Rob may.

253
0:13:25,4800 --> 0:13:31,4800
I need to topple the target in some way and find out what she intends to steal.

254
0:13:31,4800 --> 0:13:35,4800
I'll add your buying metrics to the system.

255
0:13:35,4800 --> 0:13:37,4800
They'll have full access.

256
0:13:37,4800 --> 0:13:39,4800
Once you assess what's being stolen,

257
0:13:39,4800 --> 0:13:43,4800
you have to go ahead to turning on-site.

258
0:13:43,4800 --> 0:13:45,4800
And then no problem.

259
0:13:45,4800 --> 0:13:49,4800
You know, we can purchase a good guy chair.

260
0:13:53,4800 --> 0:13:55,4800
It's unreal. It's just one little target.

261
0:13:55,4800 --> 0:13:57,4800
And...

262
0:13:57,4800 --> 0:13:59,4800
And dark.

263
0:14:23,4800 --> 0:14:27,4800
I'm going to have to go ahead and get some rest.

264
0:14:27,4800 --> 0:14:31,4800
I'm going to have to go ahead and get some rest.

265
0:14:31,4800 --> 0:14:35,4800
I'm going to have to go ahead and get some rest.

266
0:14:35,4800 --> 0:14:39,4800
I'm going to have to go ahead and get some rest.

267
0:14:39,4800 --> 0:14:43,4800
I'm going to have to go ahead and get some rest.

268
0:14:43,4800 --> 0:14:47,4800
I'm going to have to go ahead and get some rest.

269
0:14:47,4800 --> 0:14:51,4800
I'm going to have to go ahead and get some rest.

270
0:14:51,4800 --> 0:14:53,4800
All is happy.

271
0:15:11,4800 --> 0:15:13,4800
What is happening?

272
0:15:15,4800 --> 0:15:17,4800
What?

273
0:15:17,4800 --> 0:15:19,4800
No!

274
0:15:19,4800 --> 0:15:20,4800
No!

275
0:15:22,4800 --> 0:15:24,4800
It's your mind, you're my target!

276
0:15:24,4800 --> 0:15:25,4800
Your mind is...

277
0:15:50,4800 --> 0:15:52,4800
I'm not here for you.

278
0:16:11,4800 --> 0:16:12,4800
There you are.

279
0:16:12,4800 --> 0:16:13,4800
I don't want.

280
0:16:14,4800 --> 0:16:15,4800
Are you gonna live so?

281
0:16:20,4800 --> 0:16:21,4800
You're my target!

282
0:16:27,4800 --> 0:16:28,4800
You're my target!

283
0:16:32,4800 --> 0:16:34,4800
I'm gonna have to hide my way.

284
0:16:49,4800 --> 0:16:51,4800
I'm gonna have to hide my way.

285
0:17:19,4800 --> 0:17:22,4800
I'm gonna have to hide my way.

286
0:17:50,4800 --> 0:17:52,4800
I'm gonna have to hide my way.

287
0:17:52,4800 --> 0:17:54,4800
I'm gonna have to hide my way.

288
0:17:54,4800 --> 0:17:56,4800
You see, I should hide this.

289
0:17:56,4800 --> 0:17:57,4800
I don't know.

290
0:18:06,4800 --> 0:18:08,4800
I'm gonna go home alone.

291
0:18:08,4800 --> 0:18:09,4800
Hi, hi.

292
0:18:11,4800 --> 0:18:12,4800
I'm... I'm bound.

293
0:18:20,4800 --> 0:18:23,4800
This is a user with Shitari and Pantons.

294
0:18:23,4800 --> 0:18:25,4800
They're covered from the bathroom.

295
0:18:25,4800 --> 0:18:27,4800
You can't find the first responders.

296
0:18:27,4800 --> 0:18:29,4800
They came within your property.

297
0:18:29,4800 --> 0:18:30,4800
Just what makes us...

298
0:18:30,4800 --> 0:18:31,4800
It's trouble.

299
0:18:31,4800 --> 0:18:32,4800
What thing we get back to?

300
0:18:32,4800 --> 0:18:33,4800
Oh, nice.

301
0:18:33,4800 --> 0:18:34,4800
I'm welcome.

302
0:18:34,4800 --> 0:18:35,4800
Yeah.

303
0:18:35,4800 --> 0:18:36,4800
That's fine.

304
0:18:36,4800 --> 0:18:37,4800
I'm welcome.

305
0:18:37,4800 --> 0:18:38,4800
I have a thank you congressman.

306
0:18:38,4800 --> 0:18:40,4800
I'm so happy that you're here.

307
0:18:40,4800 --> 0:18:42,4800
Yeah, this is a beautiful thingy, man.

308
0:18:42,4800 --> 0:18:45,4800
The first responders is finally fired.

309
0:18:45,4800 --> 0:18:46,4800
Yes.

310
0:18:46,4800 --> 0:18:47,4800
That's cute.

311
0:18:47,4800 --> 0:18:48,4800
Cute.

312
0:18:48,4800 --> 0:18:51,4800
There's one swivel button off the CVS.

313
0:18:51,4800 --> 0:18:53,4800
Oh, no.

314
0:18:53,4800 --> 0:18:54,4800
Okay.

315
0:18:54,4800 --> 0:18:56,4800
So can you go get him now?

316
0:18:56,4800 --> 0:18:57,4800
Thank you.

317
0:18:57,4800 --> 0:18:59,4800
This is a godly, bendy, sharp, and beyond.

318
0:18:59,4800 --> 0:19:01,4800
There are bits of desperation.

319
0:19:01,4800 --> 0:19:04,4800
If you really thought that, you would be here.

320
0:19:04,4800 --> 0:19:09,4800
You're scared because your investigation of my office came up clean.

321
0:19:09,4800 --> 0:19:10,4800
Sweetly clean.

322
0:19:10,4800 --> 0:19:14,4800
Almost like someone had frantically, unreadable, the unreadable.

323
0:19:14,4800 --> 0:19:17,4800
Like someone was incredibly innocent.

324
0:19:17,4800 --> 0:19:19,4800
That is reported.

325
0:19:19,4800 --> 0:19:20,4800
Steep.

326
0:19:20,4800 --> 0:19:21,4800
, nih?

327
0:19:21,4800 --> 0:19:23,4800
Um, stuff.

328
0:19:23,4800 --> 0:19:25,4800
You crazy guys.

329
0:19:25,4800 --> 0:19:27,4800
Below proof.

330
0:19:27,4800 --> 0:19:28,4800
That's an impeachment thing.

331
0:19:28,4800 --> 0:19:38,4800
It's running out of borrow time.

332
0:19:38,4800 --> 0:19:39,4800
구.

333
0:19:39,4800 --> 0:19:42,4800
Oh.

334
0:19:42,4800 --> 0:19:44,4800
Great.

335
0:19:44,4800 --> 0:19:45,4800
Thank you.

336
0:19:45,4800 --> 0:19:47,4800
I don't know what I should do.

337
0:19:47,4800 --> 0:19:49,4800
Did someone say that?

338
0:19:49,4800 --> 0:19:51,4800
I don't know.

339
0:19:51,4800 --> 0:19:53,4800
I don't know.

340
0:19:53,4800 --> 0:19:55,4800
Did someone say that?

341
0:19:55,4800 --> 0:19:59,4800
He did believe that was up to individuals to create values.

342
0:19:59,4800 --> 0:20:03,4800
I know more.

343
0:20:03,4800 --> 0:20:05,4800
And more you do.

344
0:20:05,4800 --> 0:20:07,4800
What have you done?

345
0:20:07,4800 --> 0:20:09,4800
You're working.

346
0:20:09,4800 --> 0:20:11,4800
You're trying to get me on your side.

347
0:20:11,4800 --> 0:20:13,4800
Okay, mom.

348
0:20:13,4800 --> 0:20:15,4800
You said you know what I am.

349
0:20:15,4800 --> 0:20:17,4800
So you know my story.

350
0:20:17,4800 --> 0:20:21,4800
And you know I enjoy it so it worked for you.

351
0:20:21,4800 --> 0:20:27,4800
I need to keep volunteering on schedule.

352
0:20:27,4800 --> 0:20:29,4800
Oh, what is this?

353
0:20:29,4800 --> 0:20:31,4800
Is your trash?

354
0:20:31,4800 --> 0:20:33,4800
It's my business heart.

355
0:20:33,4800 --> 0:20:35,4800
I guess we need some help.

356
0:20:35,4800 --> 0:20:37,4800
Or you want to share some of my secret hidden evidence?

357
0:20:37,4800 --> 0:20:39,4800
Okay.

358
0:20:39,4800 --> 0:20:41,4800
Goodbye.

359
0:20:43,4800 --> 0:20:45,4800
Who are you?

360
0:20:45,4800 --> 0:20:47,4800
I'm Bob.

361
0:20:47,4800 --> 0:20:49,4800
I told you.

362
0:20:49,4800 --> 0:20:51,4800
Oh, Jesus Christ. I'm saying Bob.

363
0:20:51,4800 --> 0:20:53,4800
Who said to you Bob?

364
0:20:53,4800 --> 0:20:55,4800
Nobody. I mean I said.

365
0:20:55,4800 --> 0:20:57,4800
You were all sent.

366
0:20:57,4800 --> 0:20:59,4800
I'm not sure what's happening here.

367
0:20:59,4800 --> 0:21:01,4800
But you're all exhausting and my job is done.

368
0:21:01,4800 --> 0:21:03,4800
I'm just my job.

369
0:21:03,4800 --> 0:21:05,4800
It's just a king of iron.

370
0:21:05,4800 --> 0:21:07,4800
So no, you're not done well anywhere anymore.

371
0:21:07,4800 --> 0:21:09,4800
So you're keeping an eye on her.

372
0:21:09,4800 --> 0:21:11,4800
That's a half way used to cover for somebody stealing assets from Ox.

373
0:21:11,4800 --> 0:21:13,4800
Okay.

374
0:21:13,4800 --> 0:21:27,4800
It's clear we have all worked for Valentina in some sort of shadow ox capacity.

375
0:21:27,4800 --> 0:21:31,4800
Yeah, so all of this stuff is oxy secrets.

376
0:21:31,4800 --> 0:21:33,4800
But so are we.

377
0:21:33,4800 --> 0:21:35,4800
Which makes us like that she's an honest.

378
0:21:35,4800 --> 0:21:37,4800
Let's be for yourself.

379
0:21:37,4800 --> 0:21:39,4800
We are the evidence and this is the trailer.

380
0:21:39,4800 --> 0:21:40,4800
She wants us to go.

381
0:21:40,4800 --> 0:21:42,4800
Your theory's flawed.

382
0:21:42,4800 --> 0:21:44,4800
Please. Go on.

383
0:21:44,4800 --> 0:21:46,4800
Okay. Well, looking at the fence.

384
0:21:46,4800 --> 0:21:50,4800
The infamous ghost shield recheck on the run to the 15 missions.

385
0:21:50,4800 --> 0:21:52,4800
The dead one over there. She just probably had a boot of pass.

386
0:21:52,4800 --> 0:21:54,4800
Not talking about it.

387
0:21:54,4800 --> 0:21:56,4800
In you.

388
0:21:56,4800 --> 0:21:58,4800
The former bedroom assassin.

389
0:21:58,4800 --> 0:22:00,4800
I don't know.

390
0:22:00,4800 --> 0:22:02,4800
Put it in there because it's coming from the dime store captain America.

391
0:22:02,4800 --> 0:22:04,4800
Well, that being honest, it was actually the official captain America.

392
0:22:04,4800 --> 0:22:08,4800
Yeah, well like two seconds before you publicly murdered an innocent man in the street.

393
0:22:08,4800 --> 0:22:09,4800
I have that right.

394
0:22:09,4800 --> 0:22:10,4800
Really defiantist.

395
0:22:10,4800 --> 0:22:12,4800
Look, I'm a decorating talk that there.

396
0:22:12,4800 --> 0:22:14,4800
Okay, I have a loving wife and a son.

397
0:22:14,4800 --> 0:22:17,4800
Let's be honest, you guys are just cheap mercenaries.

398
0:22:17,4800 --> 0:22:19,4800
Okay, so I asked that I was bringing you in.

399
0:22:19,4800 --> 0:22:22,4800
That's what you think.

400
0:22:22,4800 --> 0:22:25,4800
Thank you. We needed that.

401
0:22:25,4800 --> 0:22:27,4800
We'll get accept heads in here.

402
0:22:27,4800 --> 0:22:28,4800
Forgive me.

403
0:22:28,4800 --> 0:22:34,4800
I'm not leaving here without completing my mission.

404
0:22:34,4800 --> 0:22:36,4800
I wanted to give you a clean slate guarantee.

405
0:22:36,4800 --> 0:22:38,4800
I'm unscrewing that up.

406
0:22:38,4800 --> 0:22:40,4800
This weirdo was a part of the job.

407
0:22:40,4800 --> 0:22:42,4800
So I got a note.

408
0:22:44,4800 --> 0:22:46,4800
Pass you in.

409
0:22:46,4800 --> 0:22:48,4800
I don't remember.

410
0:22:51,4800 --> 0:22:52,4800
Terrific answer.

411
0:22:52,4800 --> 0:22:53,4800
All right.

412
0:22:53,4800 --> 0:22:55,4800
Tie yourselves up.

413
0:22:55,4800 --> 0:22:57,4800
Well, no.

414
0:22:57,4800 --> 0:22:59,4800
And goodbye.

415
0:23:04,4800 --> 0:23:06,4800
Oh.

416
0:23:15,4800 --> 0:23:17,4800
Oh.

417
0:23:17,4800 --> 0:23:19,4800
You guys see that?

418
0:23:35,4800 --> 0:23:37,4800
Oh, my God.

419
0:23:37,4800 --> 0:23:40,4800
Oh, my God.

420
0:23:40,4800 --> 0:23:41,4800
You're so stupid.

421
0:23:41,4800 --> 0:23:42,4800
She's Doctor.

422
0:23:42,4800 --> 0:23:43,4800
Doctor.

423
0:23:43,4800 --> 0:23:44,4800
Yeah.

424
0:23:44,4800 --> 0:23:46,4800
I bet the need, dear.

425
0:23:46,4800 --> 0:23:48,4800
The next time, when she just texted me, I can hold her.

426
0:23:48,4800 --> 0:23:52,4800
Look, we're saying here, my wife and I came away from us to campus.

427
0:23:52,4800 --> 0:23:53,4800
That was all done.

428
0:23:53,4800 --> 0:23:54,4800
All right.

429
0:23:54,4800 --> 0:23:55,4800
We don't need to go.

430
0:23:55,4800 --> 0:23:57,4800
Roat being the darkness that would have been people to help.

431
0:23:57,4800 --> 0:23:58,4800
Hold on.

432
0:23:58,4800 --> 0:23:59,4800
You don't know what balance people love.

433
0:23:59,4800 --> 0:24:02,4800
We need to move fast and the assistance on events.

434
0:24:02,4800 --> 0:24:03,4800
But I'm just what we got.

435
0:24:03,4800 --> 0:24:07,4800
The best chance to give power and power is to whip the folks.

436
0:24:07,4800 --> 0:24:08,4800
And you can help with that.

437
0:24:08,4800 --> 0:24:10,4800
And yet, the system do its charm.

438
0:24:10,4800 --> 0:24:11,4800
This has to go.

439
0:24:11,4800 --> 0:24:12,4800
That goes on.

440
0:24:12,4800 --> 0:24:13,4800
We says every day and 4 p.m.

441
0:24:13,4800 --> 0:24:14,4800
We are in a good spot.

442
0:24:14,4800 --> 0:24:15,4800
I assure you.

443
0:24:15,4800 --> 0:24:19,4800
My team is putting together a juicy pack for the next year.

444
0:24:19,4800 --> 0:24:20,4800
Pack.

445
0:24:20,4800 --> 0:24:22,4800
Yes, buddy.

446
0:24:22,4800 --> 0:24:24,4800
Read the packets.

447
0:24:29,4800 --> 0:24:30,4800
Is it tight?

448
0:24:30,4800 --> 0:24:31,4800
Make them firm.

449
0:24:31,4800 --> 0:24:33,4800
All your guests are in attendance.

450
0:24:33,4800 --> 0:24:36,4800
And also, a five has been completely solved.

451
0:24:36,4800 --> 0:24:37,4800
All right then.

452
0:24:37,4800 --> 0:24:38,4800
All right then.

453
0:24:38,4800 --> 0:24:40,4800
Move on to the next step for...

454
0:24:40,4800 --> 0:24:41,4800
Torch now.

455
0:24:41,4800 --> 0:24:42,4800
Hey, be sure of it.

456
0:24:42,4800 --> 0:24:43,4800
Oh my god.

457
0:24:43,4800 --> 0:24:44,4800
Hey, job or not.

458
0:24:44,4800 --> 0:24:46,4800
Can you move some respect please?

459
0:24:46,4800 --> 0:24:47,4800
Yeah, Jesus.

460
0:24:47,4800 --> 0:24:48,4800
No, no.

461
0:24:48,4800 --> 0:24:49,4800
No, no.

462
0:24:49,4800 --> 0:24:50,4800
What?

463
0:24:51,4800 --> 0:24:53,4800
Show me the app.

464
0:24:53,4800 --> 0:24:54,4800
I need it.

465
0:24:59,4800 --> 0:25:00,4800
How is that?

466
0:25:00,4800 --> 0:25:01,4800
It looks like a shredder.

467
0:25:01,4800 --> 0:25:03,4800
It's an instead of a saw.

468
0:25:03,4800 --> 0:25:04,4800
Two minutes.

469
0:25:04,4800 --> 0:25:07,4800
The advantage is that it's right to clean.

470
0:25:07,4800 --> 0:25:12,4800
You know that for sure it could be for anything to be for anything to come to pick me up.

471
0:25:12,4800 --> 0:25:13,4800
It's not a problem.

472
0:25:13,4800 --> 0:25:14,4800
It's not a problem.

473
0:25:14,4800 --> 0:25:15,4800
It's not a problem.

474
0:25:15,4800 --> 0:25:16,4800
It's not a problem.

475
0:25:16,4800 --> 0:25:17,4800
It's not a problem.

476
0:25:17,4800 --> 0:25:18,4800
It's not a problem.

477
0:25:18,4800 --> 0:25:20,4800
If you need anything to be for anything to come to pick me up...

478
0:25:20,4800 --> 0:25:24,4800
Did you feel that de epidachaise rushing dramatically?

479
0:25:24,4800 --> 0:25:27,4800
Is this to real useful enough?

480
0:25:27,4800 --> 0:25:28,4800
Okay.

481
0:25:28,4800 --> 0:25:29,4800
It's not necessary.

482
0:25:29,4800 --> 0:25:31,4800
Oh, god, there's no way to go.

483
0:25:31,4800 --> 0:25:33,4800
How would you like to get a pop?

484
0:25:33,4800 --> 0:25:34,4800
Okay, go slurry.

485
0:25:34,4800 --> 0:25:35,4800
Hey, bye.

486
0:25:35,4800 --> 0:25:36,4800
Gobin with him.

487
0:25:36,4800 --> 0:25:39,4800
We need to get you two to the walls so that you could open the door.

488
0:25:39,4800 --> 0:25:40,4800
She tried that already.

489
0:25:40,4800 --> 0:25:41,4800
I know what she did,

490
0:25:41,4800 --> 0:25:43,4800
but we haven't tried shutting down the sound barrier.

491
0:25:43,4800 --> 0:25:45,4800
I built it just for her.

492
0:25:45,4800 --> 0:25:47,9800
It's gotta be in the paid power source.

493
0:25:47,9800 --> 0:25:50,4800
Come on, let's go.

494
0:25:50,4800 --> 0:25:57,4800
What exactly were we around stupid question bar?

495
0:26:11,4800 --> 0:26:13,4800
I think I found it.

496
0:26:13,4800 --> 0:26:15,4800
No!

497
0:26:17,4800 --> 0:26:19,4800
I can't go right this way.

498
0:26:21,4800 --> 0:26:22,4800
What's that work?

499
0:26:22,4800 --> 0:26:23,4800
I hope.

500
0:26:23,4800 --> 0:26:24,4800
No, no, no, no, no, no.

501
0:26:38,4800 --> 0:26:40,4800
This is your man?

502
0:26:40,4800 --> 0:26:43,4800
She's in this car.

503
0:27:11,4800 --> 0:27:13,4800
Diana!

504
0:27:16,4800 --> 0:27:18,4800
Diana!

505
0:27:21,4800 --> 0:27:23,4800
Diana, where are you?

506
0:27:28,4800 --> 0:27:29,4800
What?

507
0:27:29,4800 --> 0:27:32,4800
I'm gonna be in a trance.

508
0:27:32,4800 --> 0:27:34,4800
You got it?

509
0:27:34,4800 --> 0:27:35,4800
I'm gonna go.

510
0:27:35,4800 --> 0:27:36,4800
I'm gonna go.

511
0:27:41,4800 --> 0:27:43,4800
I'm gonna be in a trance.

512
0:27:46,4800 --> 0:27:48,4800
I'm gonna be in a trance.

513
0:27:59,4800 --> 0:28:01,4800
I'm gonna get you in.

514
0:28:01,4800 --> 0:28:03,4800
I'm gonna be in a trance.

515
0:28:10,4800 --> 0:28:13,4800
You okay?

516
0:28:14,4800 --> 0:28:18,4800
Yeah, I'm fine.

517
0:28:20,4800 --> 0:28:21,4800
Hey!

518
0:28:21,4800 --> 0:28:24,4800
Didn't think you'd come back, think.

519
0:28:24,4800 --> 0:28:28,4800
I'm going to be a trance.

520
0:28:28,4800 --> 0:28:31,4800
I'm going to be in a trance.

521
0:28:31,4800 --> 0:28:34,4800
I'm gonna be a trance.

522
0:28:34,4800 --> 0:28:37,4800
I'm gonna be in a trance.

523
0:28:37,4800 --> 0:28:40,4800
Hey, this is Vicky from Mac, thanks.

524
0:28:40,4800 --> 0:28:43,4800
I had to use something to pop up the house in the other way.

525
0:28:45,4800 --> 0:28:46,4800
Close the door please.

526
0:28:46,4800 --> 0:28:47,4800
At least we can move.

527
0:28:47,4800 --> 0:28:48,4800
You know?

528
0:28:49,4800 --> 0:28:51,4800
Okay, but is that the amount?

529
0:28:51,4800 --> 0:28:52,4800
Just let it out already.

530
0:28:52,4800 --> 0:28:53,4800
What?

531
0:28:53,4800 --> 0:28:55,4800
Oh, it's your guests.

532
0:28:55,4800 --> 0:28:58,4800
If somehow I've hated the house for a minute.

533
0:28:59,4800 --> 0:29:00,4800
Oh.

534
0:29:00,4800 --> 0:29:03,4800
And is it possible that they've maybe...

535
0:29:03,4800 --> 0:29:05,4800
To me the force is against you.

536
0:29:05,4800 --> 0:29:09,4800
Oh, Mac, these are defective.

537
0:29:09,4800 --> 0:29:11,4800
Those who are sick.

538
0:29:11,4800 --> 0:29:14,4800
Anti-social tragedy and human form.

539
0:29:14,4800 --> 0:29:18,4800
You know, honestly, I cannot think the worst group of people trying to work together.

540
0:29:18,4800 --> 0:29:19,4800
It got that.

541
0:29:19,4800 --> 0:29:20,4800
Right.

542
0:29:20,4800 --> 0:29:23,4800
It's just that little foot there.

543
0:29:23,4800 --> 0:29:25,4800
And looking together.

544
0:29:28,4800 --> 0:29:29,4800
What?

545
0:29:32,4800 --> 0:29:33,4800
Who the hell is this guy?

546
0:29:34,4800 --> 0:29:35,4800
I have no idea.

547
0:29:35,4800 --> 0:29:37,4800
I didn't idea on Charmedo.

548
0:29:37,4800 --> 0:29:43,4800
I want to know how this man boy got into my supposedly incentable stronghold.

549
0:29:43,4800 --> 0:29:46,4800
I called Hold to get the law of warrants.

550
0:29:46,4800 --> 0:29:48,4800
I want the false tried to rob us.

551
0:29:48,4800 --> 0:29:50,4800
We need to end this now.

552
0:29:50,4800 --> 0:29:51,4800
Call him now.

553
0:30:04,4800 --> 0:30:07,4800
Everybody's got our reasons for being here.

554
0:30:07,4800 --> 0:30:08,4800
It's this guy.

555
0:30:08,4800 --> 0:30:09,4800
Hey, Bobby.

556
0:30:09,4800 --> 0:30:10,4800
Let's talk to yourself.

557
0:30:10,4800 --> 0:30:12,4800
We're talking to us.

558
0:30:15,4800 --> 0:30:16,4800
Oh, shit.

559
0:30:16,4800 --> 0:30:17,4800
All right.

560
0:30:17,4800 --> 0:30:19,4800
You tell me how you got in here right goddamn now.

561
0:30:19,4800 --> 0:30:20,4800
I swear, man.

562
0:30:20,4800 --> 0:30:22,4800
I just woke up in this place.

563
0:30:22,4800 --> 0:30:26,4800
One minute I was, you know, getting my blood jaunta, his medical study, and then I started to get in here.

564
0:30:26,4800 --> 0:30:28,4800
Getting back to John was, I don't know what's happening.

565
0:30:28,4800 --> 0:30:31,4800
Okay, then show me where you woke up.

566
0:30:31,4800 --> 0:30:32,4800
Oh, God.

567
0:30:32,4800 --> 0:30:33,4800
In there.

568
0:30:33,4800 --> 0:30:35,4800
Where everything's on fire.

569
0:30:35,4800 --> 0:30:36,4800
That's real convenient.

570
0:30:36,4800 --> 0:30:37,4800
Welcome to life.

571
0:30:37,4800 --> 0:30:39,4800
Do you remember anything?

572
0:30:39,4800 --> 0:30:41,4800
I gave you a hand in the evening.

573
0:30:41,4800 --> 0:30:42,4800
No.

574
0:30:42,4800 --> 0:30:43,4800
Choke hall, nerve pinch.

575
0:30:43,4800 --> 0:30:44,4800
No.

576
0:30:44,4800 --> 0:30:47,4800
I think he's just a civilian.

577
0:30:47,4800 --> 0:30:50,4800
If he's a civilian, he knows too much of an agent.

578
0:30:50,4800 --> 0:30:51,4800
It sucks.

579
0:30:51,4800 --> 0:30:54,4800
Either way, I said we'd throw him back in the fire.

580
0:30:54,4800 --> 0:30:55,4800
Okay.

581
0:30:55,4800 --> 0:31:00,4800
So, you said you're captive America.

582
0:31:00,4800 --> 0:31:02,4800
Where you left him?

583
0:31:02,4800 --> 0:31:06,4800
Just, you're in a household.

584
0:31:06,4800 --> 0:31:08,4800
You know.

585
0:31:08,4800 --> 0:31:09,4800
Yeah.

586
0:31:09,4800 --> 0:31:13,4800
Who's just a body?

587
0:31:13,4800 --> 0:31:14,4800
Okay.

588
0:31:14,4800 --> 0:31:15,4800
Okay.

589
0:31:15,4800 --> 0:31:16,4800
Okay.

590
0:31:16,4800 --> 0:31:17,4800
Okay.

591
0:31:17,4800 --> 0:31:18,4800
Okay.

592
0:31:18,4800 --> 0:31:19,4800
Okay.

593
0:31:19,4800 --> 0:31:20,4800
Whoa.

594
0:31:20,4800 --> 0:31:24,4800
When swanard turning next, it was a lot of fun.

595
0:31:24,4800 --> 0:31:26,4800
You go over there.

596
0:31:26,4800 --> 0:31:28,4800
Well, it will be.

597
0:31:29,4800 --> 0:31:31,4800
Oh, yeah.

598
0:31:31,4800 --> 0:31:32,4800
What?

599
0:31:32,4800 --> 0:31:33,4800
Oh, fun.

600
0:31:33,4800 --> 0:31:35,4800
What do you find?

601
0:31:35,4800 --> 0:31:37,4800
You're not seeing fun.

602
0:31:37,4800 --> 0:31:39,4800
Yeah, well, we've only just met.

603
0:31:39,4800 --> 0:31:41,4800
This is...

604
0:31:41,4800 --> 0:31:42,4800
Oh, yeah.

605
0:31:42,4800 --> 0:31:44,4800
Oh, yeah?

606
0:31:44,4800 --> 0:31:47,4800
We're talking to yourself.

607
0:31:47,4800 --> 0:31:49,4800
You're more aggressive.

608
0:31:49,4800 --> 0:31:50,4800
I mean, that...

609
0:31:50,4800 --> 0:31:52,4800
I guess we'll take some trouble.

610
0:31:52,4800 --> 0:31:53,4800
Oh, I get it.

611
0:31:53,4800 --> 0:31:54,4800
He sucks.

612
0:31:54,4800 --> 0:31:59,4800
But we have to work together to get out of here, so...

613
0:31:59,4800 --> 0:32:01,4800
Well, you guys are just going out of here.

614
0:32:01,4800 --> 0:32:02,4800
It'll be easier.

615
0:32:02,4800 --> 0:32:04,4800
Oh, not do dying on the air.

616
0:32:04,4800 --> 0:32:05,4800
Yeah.

617
0:32:05,4800 --> 0:32:06,4800
Well, whatever.

618
0:32:06,4800 --> 0:32:10,4800
I think everyone's better off if I just say it, but...

619
0:32:13,4800 --> 0:32:14,4800
Okay.

620
0:32:14,4800 --> 0:32:15,4800
I understand.

621
0:32:15,4800 --> 0:32:17,4800
I don't feel it shit sometimes.

622
0:32:17,4800 --> 0:32:19,4800
And loneliness, I get that.

623
0:32:19,4800 --> 0:32:20,4800
I get it.

624
0:32:20,4800 --> 0:32:23,4800
And that darkness gets pretty enticing.

625
0:32:23,4800 --> 0:32:28,4800
And then it starts to feel a little bit like...

626
0:32:31,4800 --> 0:32:32,4800
Avoid.

627
0:32:35,4800 --> 0:32:37,4800
And avoid.

628
0:32:41,4800 --> 0:32:43,4800
What do you do about it?

629
0:32:47,4800 --> 0:32:49,4800
You're shoving it right now.

630
0:32:49,4800 --> 0:32:51,4800
You just push it.

631
0:32:51,4800 --> 0:32:53,4800
Done.

632
0:32:53,4800 --> 0:32:56,4800
That's pretty good advice.

633
0:32:56,4800 --> 0:32:58,4800
Get it, get it up.

634
0:32:58,4800 --> 0:33:01,4800
Oh!

635
0:33:01,4800 --> 0:33:06,4800
You have to be editing it that way out.

636
0:33:06,4800 --> 0:33:08,4800
Look.

637
0:33:08,4800 --> 0:33:10,4800
We're all alone.

638
0:33:10,4800 --> 0:33:12,4800
All of us.

639
0:33:12,4800 --> 0:33:15,4800
Let's just think together until we make it to the surface.

640
0:33:15,4800 --> 0:33:18,4800
And after that, you can start a fight with the Soul Soldier.

641
0:33:18,4800 --> 0:33:19,4800
Get yourself killed.

642
0:33:19,4800 --> 0:33:20,4800
I don't care.

643
0:33:20,4800 --> 0:33:21,4800
Okay.

644
0:33:21,4800 --> 0:33:23,4800
No.

645
0:33:23,4800 --> 0:33:25,4800
Yeah.

646
0:33:26,4800 --> 0:33:28,4800
Yeah.

647
0:33:48,4800 --> 0:33:49,4800
Hello?

648
0:33:49,4800 --> 0:33:51,4800
Hey, this is a...

649
0:33:51,4800 --> 0:33:52,4800
Mel.

650
0:33:52,4800 --> 0:33:53,4800
Mel?

651
0:33:53,4800 --> 0:33:54,4800
Hi.

652
0:33:55,4800 --> 0:33:56,4800
You call?

653
0:33:56,4800 --> 0:33:57,4800
I did.

654
0:33:57,4800 --> 0:33:59,4800
I know they're gonna do DC.

655
0:33:59,4800 --> 0:34:01,4800
And I wanted to...

656
0:34:01,4800 --> 0:34:02,4800
network.

657
0:34:02,4800 --> 0:34:04,4800
Network.

658
0:34:04,4800 --> 0:34:08,4800
So, how are you feeling about your new job?

659
0:34:08,4800 --> 0:34:10,4800
Oh, it's great.

660
0:34:10,4800 --> 0:34:12,4800
Love it.

661
0:34:12,4800 --> 0:34:15,4800
It's not each of these drinks, you know.

662
0:34:15,4800 --> 0:34:18,4800
I was in high school when the animals came.

663
0:34:18,4800 --> 0:34:20,4800
And the Avengers.

664
0:34:20,4800 --> 0:34:24,4800
High school, how was that 90?

665
0:34:24,4800 --> 0:34:26,4800
It's kinda strange.

666
0:34:26,4800 --> 0:34:28,4800
But it's all over now, right?

667
0:34:28,4800 --> 0:34:31,4800
I mean, Avengers you're calling.

668
0:34:31,4800 --> 0:34:34,4800
No one else is coming to save the day.

669
0:34:34,4800 --> 0:34:37,4800
Yeah, we could keep a people out of company.

670
0:34:37,4800 --> 0:34:39,4800
Just coming in.

671
0:34:39,4800 --> 0:34:41,4800
You testify against her.

672
0:34:41,4800 --> 0:34:43,4800
You less really not know my boss.

673
0:34:43,4800 --> 0:34:45,4800
We can protect you.

674
0:34:45,4800 --> 0:34:46,4800
Oh, can you?

675
0:34:46,4800 --> 0:34:49,4800
Is that filmed from the freshman of congressman who hasn't gotten the bill passed?

676
0:34:49,4800 --> 0:34:51,4800
Or the old Winter Soldier?

677
0:34:51,4800 --> 0:34:52,4800
Come on, man.

678
0:34:52,4800 --> 0:34:53,4800
Just keep this up.

679
0:34:53,4800 --> 0:34:54,4800
Okay.

680
0:34:54,4800 --> 0:34:56,4800
You can treat me now.

681
0:34:56,4800 --> 0:34:57,4800
Yes, I can.

682
0:34:57,4800 --> 0:34:58,4800
But I don't feel that anymore.

683
0:34:58,4800 --> 0:34:59,4800
Thank you.

684
0:34:59,4800 --> 0:35:01,4800
Congressman, have a great night.

685
0:35:01,4800 --> 0:35:11,4800
So, now that we're still alive,

686
0:35:11,4800 --> 0:35:21,4800
what do I just have to ensure?

687
0:35:21,4800 --> 0:35:22,4800
Don't worry.

688
0:35:22,4800 --> 0:35:23,4800
I got to.

689
0:35:23,4800 --> 0:35:31,4800
You should try it again.

690
0:35:31,4800 --> 0:35:34,4800
Oh, twenty-four.

691
0:35:34,4800 --> 0:35:36,4800
I'm here.

692
0:35:37,4800 --> 0:35:39,4800
You should try it again.

693
0:35:39,4800 --> 0:35:40,4800
Oh, twenty-four.

694
0:35:40,4800 --> 0:35:41,4800
I'm here.

695
0:35:41,4800 --> 0:35:44,4800
Okay, okay.

696
0:35:44,4800 --> 0:35:47,4800
Why don't you walk up through the walls or whatever,

697
0:35:47,4800 --> 0:35:49,4800
and just throw us a rope down?

698
0:35:49,4800 --> 0:35:50,4800
Yes.

699
0:35:50,4800 --> 0:35:53,4800
Okay, well first of all, someone other than you will have to ask me.

700
0:35:53,4800 --> 0:35:55,4800
And second of all, I have to know what I'm going.

701
0:35:55,4800 --> 0:35:57,4800
Because I've never been able to hold it on with an unit.

702
0:35:57,4800 --> 0:35:59,4800
So I just get lost in motion and then I'll be crushed in that.

703
0:35:59,4800 --> 0:36:00,4800
Right?

704
0:36:00,4800 --> 0:36:01,4800
Just a nap.

705
0:36:01,4800 --> 0:36:02,4800
Not sure.

706
0:36:02,4800 --> 0:36:04,4800
Oh my god, this...

707
0:36:05,4800 --> 0:36:07,4800
I don't know.

708
0:36:07,4800 --> 0:36:09,4800
I don't know.

709
0:36:09,4800 --> 0:36:11,4800
Yeah, he's right.

710
0:36:11,4800 --> 0:36:12,4800
What?

711
0:36:12,4800 --> 0:36:13,4800
I don't know.

712
0:36:13,4800 --> 0:36:14,4800
What?

713
0:36:14,4800 --> 0:36:15,4800
What's wrong with you?

714
0:36:15,4800 --> 0:36:16,4800
It was wet.

715
0:36:16,4800 --> 0:36:18,4800
I went hot, sorry.

716
0:36:18,4800 --> 0:36:20,4800
Someone's going to weird hard, but...

717
0:36:20,4800 --> 0:36:21,4800
It's not my lunch.

718
0:36:21,4800 --> 0:36:22,4800
It's my soup.

719
0:36:22,4800 --> 0:36:24,4800
Well, I'll give it to the girl in your cell.

720
0:36:24,4800 --> 0:36:28,4800
About an evening, you know, it's like an entire life in the last.

721
0:36:28,4800 --> 0:36:31,4800
Helped up to machines where you create this physical cage to keep

722
0:36:31,4800 --> 0:36:33,4800
material bodies disintegrates in the old times.

723
0:36:33,4800 --> 0:36:34,4800
I'm sorry.

724
0:36:34,4800 --> 0:36:35,4800
I'm not that bad.

725
0:36:35,4800 --> 0:36:37,4800
I don't want to start double-sauce story here.

726
0:36:37,4800 --> 0:36:41,4800
I win in my slave child assassin over here.

727
0:36:41,4800 --> 0:36:43,4800
Oh, there's kids, though.

728
0:36:43,4800 --> 0:36:45,4800
Oh, so that's a good thing, though.

729
0:36:45,4800 --> 0:36:48,4800
I'm just thinking about being like Simone, each one of you know me.

730
0:36:48,4800 --> 0:36:49,4800
Thanks.

731
0:36:49,4800 --> 0:36:50,4800
You'll wave it.

732
0:36:50,4800 --> 0:36:51,4800
Oh, god.

733
0:36:51,4800 --> 0:36:52,4800
Hold it.

734
0:36:52,4800 --> 0:36:54,4800
Oh.

735
0:36:54,4800 --> 0:36:57,4800
Oh.

736
0:36:57,4800 --> 0:36:58,4800
Okay.

737
0:36:58,4800 --> 0:36:59,4800
Okay.

738
0:36:59,4800 --> 0:37:00,4800
Hey.

739
0:37:00,4800 --> 0:37:01,4800
What the?

740
0:37:01,4800 --> 0:37:03,4800
Where are you gasping?

741
0:37:03,4800 --> 0:37:05,4800
Please don't gasp at work.

742
0:37:05,4800 --> 0:37:07,4800
It's John Doe.

743
0:37:07,4800 --> 0:37:09,4800
He's a sentry project.

744
0:37:09,4800 --> 0:37:13,4800
Yeah, everyone who went through sentry project is Dan Mel.

745
0:37:13,4800 --> 0:37:16,4800
That's why we're in this whole stupid mess.

746
0:37:16,4800 --> 0:37:19,4800
Yeah, but look, there.

747
0:37:19,4800 --> 0:37:22,4800
On the Reynolds entered the pre-trial program in Malaysia.

748
0:37:22,4800 --> 0:37:26,4800
And he had a real rough go before that went into the test subjects.

749
0:37:26,4800 --> 0:37:28,4800
How did he get in my vault?

750
0:37:28,4800 --> 0:37:30,4800
He was supposed to be dead.

751
0:37:30,4800 --> 0:37:33,4800
He threw her out with the rest of the evidence.

752
0:37:33,4800 --> 0:37:37,4800
He survived the procedure that means...

753
0:37:37,4800 --> 0:37:38,4800
Yeah.

754
0:37:38,4800 --> 0:37:42,4800
In my entry, I was going to be a little bit more patient.

755
0:37:42,4800 --> 0:37:44,4800
I was going to be a little bit more patient.

756
0:37:44,4800 --> 0:37:46,4800
I was going to be a little bit more patient.

757
0:37:46,4800 --> 0:37:48,4800
I was just interested in the procedure that means...

758
0:37:48,4800 --> 0:37:49,4800
Yeah.

759
0:37:49,4800 --> 0:37:51,4800
It might actually work.

760
0:37:51,4800 --> 0:37:52,4800
Oh, my God.

761
0:37:52,4800 --> 0:37:54,4800
Oh, my God.

762
0:37:57,4800 --> 0:37:59,4800
It was crazy!

763
0:37:59,4800 --> 0:38:01,4800
I'm going to see the phone!

764
0:38:01,4800 --> 0:38:04,4800
We know talking about how high up we are.

765
0:38:04,4800 --> 0:38:06,4800
I'm not sure how big it was.

766
0:38:06,4800 --> 0:38:08,4800
I'm going to see the door.

767
0:38:08,4800 --> 0:38:09,4800
Yeah.

768
0:38:09,4800 --> 0:38:11,4800
How big.

769
0:38:11,4800 --> 0:38:13,4800
How?

770
0:38:13,4800 --> 0:38:14,4800
Yeah.

771
0:38:14,4800 --> 0:38:16,4800
I guess more than once.

772
0:38:16,4800 --> 0:38:18,4800
Shut down.

773
0:38:18,4800 --> 0:38:20,4800
So?

774
0:38:20,4800 --> 0:38:23,4800
I was just reading immediately, bold.

775
0:38:23,4800 --> 0:38:24,4800
Shut up.

776
0:38:24,4800 --> 0:38:27,4800
Sorry, I guess I didn't really hate this program.

777
0:38:27,4800 --> 0:38:29,4800
Genius plan, Bobby.

778
0:38:29,4800 --> 0:38:31,4800
Always making things worse.

779
0:38:31,4800 --> 0:38:32,4800
I was bloody big.

780
0:38:32,4800 --> 0:38:34,4800
I can't hold this much longer.

781
0:38:34,4800 --> 0:38:35,4800
Hey, can you return?

782
0:38:35,4800 --> 0:38:36,4800
I can reach.

783
0:38:36,4800 --> 0:38:37,4800
What?

784
0:38:37,4800 --> 0:38:39,4800
No way! You're just gonna leave us.

785
0:38:39,4800 --> 0:38:40,4800
Okay.

786
0:38:40,4800 --> 0:38:41,4800
Be honest, Ronald.

787
0:38:41,4800 --> 0:38:42,4800
I can latch us on.

788
0:38:42,4800 --> 0:38:44,4800
I'm not spitting us around.

789
0:38:44,4800 --> 0:38:45,4800
Okay, somebody's got to go through.

790
0:38:45,4800 --> 0:38:46,4800
You come on, you come on.

791
0:38:46,4800 --> 0:38:48,4800
What? The hell is happening?

792
0:38:48,4800 --> 0:38:50,4800
Don't let somebody tell me that you can stop me.

793
0:38:50,4800 --> 0:38:51,4800
It's a huge brain.

794
0:38:51,4800 --> 0:38:52,4800
I know it's just a yellow key.

795
0:38:52,4800 --> 0:38:53,4800
Okay.

796
0:38:53,4800 --> 0:38:54,4800
I have to sneeze a bit if I sneeze.

797
0:38:54,4800 --> 0:38:55,4800
You know that?

798
0:38:55,4800 --> 0:38:56,4800
I'm getting those controls.

799
0:38:56,4800 --> 0:38:58,4800
Saying, okay, I can get us all out of your energy video first.

800
0:38:58,4800 --> 0:38:59,4800
Yeah, that's the thing.

801
0:38:59,4800 --> 0:39:00,4800
I'm going to go right away.

802
0:39:00,4800 --> 0:39:01,4800
Hello.

803
0:39:01,4800 --> 0:39:02,4800
Oh.

804
0:39:02,4800 --> 0:39:03,4800
You know me.

805
0:39:03,4800 --> 0:39:04,4800
I'm joking.

806
0:39:04,4800 --> 0:39:05,4800
I know me.

807
0:39:05,4800 --> 0:39:06,4800
Give me a hug.

808
0:39:06,4800 --> 0:39:07,4800
I got you.

809
0:39:07,4800 --> 0:39:08,4800
Whoa!

810
0:39:08,4800 --> 0:39:09,4800
Whoa!

811
0:39:09,4800 --> 0:39:10,4800
Whoa!

812
0:39:10,4800 --> 0:39:12,4800
Whoa!

813
0:39:12,4800 --> 0:39:13,4800
Whoa!

814
0:39:13,4800 --> 0:39:14,4800
Whoa!

815
0:39:14,4800 --> 0:39:15,4800
Whoa!

816
0:39:15,4800 --> 0:39:16,4800
Whoa!

817
0:39:16,4800 --> 0:39:17,4800
Whoa!

818
0:39:17,4800 --> 0:39:18,4800
Whoa!

819
0:39:18,4800 --> 0:39:19,4800
Whoa!

820
0:39:19,4800 --> 0:39:20,4800
Whoa!

821
0:39:22,4800 --> 0:39:23,4800
Dessertitch, drink.

822
0:39:23,4800 --> 0:39:25,4800
Did I not hear it all safe?

823
0:39:25,4800 --> 0:39:29,6400
The attached bullet sentence here on stage, these are sure all ears.

824
0:39:31,2400 --> 0:39:34,4400
Pretty grateful if you asked me, but can you make a body?

825
0:39:36,9200 --> 0:39:39,3200
I'm so excited to be able to start my leg and just do it.

826
0:39:49,8000 --> 0:39:50,6000
What's on?

827
0:39:51,4000 --> 0:39:51,8800
What?

828
0:39:52,8400 --> 0:39:54,6800
Are you watching it?

829
0:39:55,7200 --> 0:39:56,2000
What?

830
0:39:56,2000 --> 0:39:57,3200
Doing it and watching it.

831
0:40:08,9200 --> 0:40:09,6400
What?

832
0:40:09,6400 --> 0:40:10,5200
I'll leave you one.

833
0:40:10,5200 --> 0:40:11
What?

834
0:40:11 --> 0:40:11,7200
What's the meanst?

835
0:40:11,7200 --> 0:40:12,9200
I'm watching it, it's five.

836
0:40:12,9200 --> 0:40:13,9600
You're eating your phone.

837
0:40:15,6400 --> 0:40:18,6000
You don't like the way I do it and you can do it yourself, okay?

838
0:40:22,2000 --> 0:40:22,8400
I can't do this.

839
0:40:32,5200 --> 0:40:33,4000
Waterproof.

840
0:40:35,9600 --> 0:40:37,9600
What the hell are you doing?

841
0:40:47,0800 --> 0:40:48,4400
ve I've got a coat.

842
0:40:48,4400 --> 0:41:13,2400
I'm gonna take a look at the person we're gonna do.

843
0:41:13,2400 --> 0:41:14,2400
I'm boss now, keep.

844
0:41:14,2400 --> 0:41:16,2400
Oh yeah, it's really a chance of getting out of here.

845
0:41:16,2400 --> 0:41:18,2400
I think I might just sit right there, probably.

846
0:41:18,2400 --> 0:41:19,2400
Okay, fine, we have for ourselves.

847
0:41:19,2400 --> 0:41:20,2400
Why should I be in charge?

848
0:41:20,2400 --> 0:41:22,2400
You almost threw all of us right there.

849
0:41:22,2400 --> 0:41:23,2400
Well, let's see.

850
0:41:23,2400 --> 0:41:26,2400
We're in the trenches in every work-time country on this planet.

851
0:41:26,2400 --> 0:41:29,2400
I rescue god knows how many hostages and should be answered to US presence.

852
0:41:29,2400 --> 0:41:30,2400
What else?

853
0:41:30,2400 --> 0:41:32,2400
Oh, I just want to take football cheers.

854
0:41:32,2400 --> 0:41:34,2400
Back to back to back to Beres.

855
0:41:34,2400 --> 0:41:35,2400
Oh, wow.

856
0:41:35,2400 --> 0:41:39,2400
When I was five, I was in the pubes of a team called the West Jessica Valley Thunderbolts,

857
0:41:39,2400 --> 0:41:43,2400
sponsored by Shane's Fire Shop, where one zero games of one time is called

858
0:41:43,2400 --> 0:41:45,2400
Mendeschen in a poet midfield.

859
0:41:45,2400 --> 0:41:48,2400
Anyone else having pointless childhood stories to tell?

860
0:41:48,2400 --> 0:41:50,2400
Kurokina laf is a...

861
0:41:50,2400 --> 0:41:53,2400
You're not addicted to science, do you like chicken?

862
0:41:53,2400 --> 0:41:55,2400
So, somewhere job.

863
0:41:55,2400 --> 0:41:57,2400
Right, okay, here's the plan.

864
0:41:57,2400 --> 0:41:59,2400
We set up an explosion to bring them in.

865
0:41:59,2400 --> 0:42:01,2400
I don't know, too many variables in the explosion.

866
0:42:01,2400 --> 0:42:03,2400
They tell on their night vision you handle the first wave,

867
0:42:03,2400 --> 0:42:05,2400
but you wait for me after I've blinded the remaining.

868
0:42:05,2400 --> 0:42:06,2400
So there's no way for me?

869
0:42:06,2400 --> 0:42:08,2400
It will only work if you wait.

870
0:42:08,2400 --> 0:42:09,2400
So, what?

871
0:42:09,2400 --> 0:42:11,2400
Ever you find this safe here?

872
0:42:15,2400 --> 0:42:17,2400
Who would I be?

873
0:42:17,2400 --> 0:42:20,2400
You stay behind me, log.

874
0:42:23,2400 --> 0:42:24,2400
Let's do this.

875
0:42:29,2400 --> 0:42:31,2400
What's the latest?

876
0:42:31,2400 --> 0:42:33,2400
We're talking in, man.

877
0:42:33,2400 --> 0:42:35,2400
Now, come with some raw labels. It's no way out.

878
0:42:35,2400 --> 0:42:36,2400
Reach team ready.

879
0:42:36,2400 --> 0:42:37,2400
It's a front.

880
0:42:37,2400 --> 0:42:39,2400
It's gonna be not in the photo, Paul.

881
0:42:39,2400 --> 0:42:41,2400
Not at least.

882
0:42:41,2400 --> 0:42:43,2400
No told you, it's not at least.

883
0:42:43,2400 --> 0:42:45,2400
Paul, I'm telling you now, hold.

884
0:42:45,2400 --> 0:42:46,2400
It's just...

885
0:42:46,2400 --> 0:42:47,2400
It's gonna work.

886
0:42:47,2400 --> 0:42:48,2400
I'm trying to plan it for at least.

887
0:42:48,2400 --> 0:42:50,2400
Then change the plan.

888
0:42:50,2400 --> 0:42:51,2400
Okay, there's somebody inside there.

889
0:42:51,2400 --> 0:42:53,2400
I don't look catching any straights.

890
0:42:56,2400 --> 0:42:58,2400
It's a 13-4-Header now.

891
0:42:58,2400 --> 0:43:00,2400
Run, Lee.

892
0:43:07,2400 --> 0:43:09,2400
I'm gonna get it.

893
0:43:19,2400 --> 0:43:20,2400
I'm gonna do it.

894
0:43:20,2400 --> 0:43:21,2400
I'll go back home.

895
0:43:21,2400 --> 0:43:22,2400
Okay.

896
0:43:22,2400 --> 0:43:24,2400
Okay, I should have gone.

897
0:43:24,2400 --> 0:43:26,2400
No, I don't think so.

898
0:43:26,2400 --> 0:43:28,2400
We're not gonna need working on the outside, right?

899
0:43:28,2400 --> 0:43:30,2400
Mm-hmm. I'll set.

900
0:43:30,2400 --> 0:43:31,2400
Just have a run.

901
0:43:33,2400 --> 0:43:35,2400
The medical child was supposed to need me better.

902
0:43:35,2400 --> 0:43:36,2400
Not to like...

903
0:43:36,2400 --> 0:43:38,2400
We're gonna have to help.

904
0:43:40,2400 --> 0:43:43,2400
It's not you said we didn't know anything about it.

905
0:43:44,2400 --> 0:43:50,2400
I'm not watching, just remember they said it was for people who wanted to make something better than themselves.

906
0:43:50,2400 --> 0:43:53,2400
You can trust me, Bob.

907
0:43:54,2400 --> 0:43:56,2400
Can I?

908
0:43:56,2400 --> 0:43:58,2400
No, not at all.

909
0:43:58,2400 --> 0:44:06,2400
I always had these episodes since I was a kid.

910
0:44:06,2400 --> 0:44:12,2400
There's a high, there's a big low, and then I'm gonna just go as black.

911
0:44:14,2400 --> 0:44:18,2400
But this time, I feel like there's something bad happening to her.

912
0:44:18,2400 --> 0:44:19,2400
I did something bad.

913
0:44:19,2400 --> 0:44:21,2400
I mean, I don't hear the bad things.

914
0:44:21,2400 --> 0:44:24,2400
So he was just like a whole new kind.

915
0:44:24,2400 --> 0:44:25,2400
Yeah.

916
0:44:26,2400 --> 0:44:28,2400
I found him.

917
0:44:30,2400 --> 0:44:32,2400
No.

918
0:44:32,2400 --> 0:44:34,2400
Why did that not work?

919
0:44:34,2400 --> 0:44:37,2400
You guys turn on the power of that guy, and you get blinded.

920
0:44:37,2400 --> 0:44:39,2400
Yeah, so you know that, Bob.

921
0:44:39,2400 --> 0:44:40,2400
That was your plan.

922
0:44:40,2400 --> 0:44:42,2400
There's nothing helpful, Bob, give me that.

923
0:44:42,2400 --> 0:44:44,2400
All right, it's a sad life.

924
0:44:44,2400 --> 0:44:45,2400
The walk to his right hand.

925
0:44:45,2400 --> 0:44:47,2400
His name is Walker Bob.

926
0:44:49,2400 --> 0:44:51,2400
You're gonna let's you later.

927
0:44:56,2400 --> 0:44:58,2400
You can't even do it myself.

928
0:45:05,2400 --> 0:45:09,2400
I will repeat, Tango Fox try to leave on requesting report.

929
0:45:11,2400 --> 0:45:14,2400
Next team up, get in there.

930
0:45:18,2400 --> 0:45:19,2400
Where is he?

931
0:45:19,2400 --> 0:45:20,2400
He's gone.

932
0:45:20,2400 --> 0:45:23,2400
Henry man's room self, right?

933
0:45:23,2400 --> 0:45:24,2400
I'm sure.

934
0:45:42,2400 --> 0:45:43,2400
I can go.

935
0:45:43,2400 --> 0:45:44,2400
Stay behind me.

936
0:45:44,2400 --> 0:45:45,2400
Henry man, I'm gonna go.

937
0:45:45,2400 --> 0:45:46,2400
Stay behind me.

938
0:45:46,2400 --> 0:45:47,2400
Go, go, go.

939
0:45:48,2400 --> 0:45:49,2400
Who's that?

940
0:45:51,2400 --> 0:45:52,2400
Who's that?

941
0:45:52,2400 --> 0:45:53,2400
I didn't hear that.

942
0:45:53,2400 --> 0:45:54,2400
What way is that?

943
0:45:54,2400 --> 0:45:55,2400
I can tell.

944
0:45:59,2400 --> 0:46:00,2400
Kick it.

945
0:46:00,2400 --> 0:46:01,2400
Kick it.

946
0:46:01,2400 --> 0:46:02,2400
Another car run you through.

947
0:46:02,2400 --> 0:46:03,2400
Enjoy it.

948
0:46:09,2400 --> 0:46:10,2400
Stop right there.

949
0:46:10,2400 --> 0:46:11,2400
I'm gonna run.

950
0:46:14,2400 --> 0:46:16,2400
That was my fault.

951
0:46:16,2400 --> 0:46:17,2400
Henry.

952
0:46:17,2400 --> 0:46:18,2400
No.

953
0:46:18,2400 --> 0:46:19,2400
No.

954
0:46:19,2400 --> 0:46:20,2400
No.

955
0:46:20,2400 --> 0:46:21,2400
No.

956
0:46:21,2400 --> 0:46:23,2400
Hey, go stop.

957
0:46:23,2400 --> 0:46:24,2400
Where are you?

958
0:46:24,2400 --> 0:46:25,2400
Where are you?

959
0:46:25,2400 --> 0:46:26,2400
The explosion fragilized.

960
0:46:26,2400 --> 0:46:28,2400
It's all due to many variables.

961
0:46:28,2400 --> 0:46:29,2400
I knew it.

962
0:46:29,2400 --> 0:46:30,2400
And then you didn't wait.

963
0:46:30,2400 --> 0:46:31,2400
I did wait.

964
0:46:31,2400 --> 0:46:32,2400
And then...

965
0:46:34,2400 --> 0:46:35,2400
Okay.

966
0:46:35,2400 --> 0:46:38,2400
I probably got about 60 seconds to do my voice.

967
0:46:38,2400 --> 0:46:41,2400
I think it was literally actually the issue was supposed to.

968
0:46:41,2400 --> 0:46:43,2400
Maybe we'll all get out of here alive.

969
0:46:47,2400 --> 0:46:49,2400
I'm gonna run.

970
0:46:49,2400 --> 0:46:51,2400
I'm gonna run.

971
0:46:51,2400 --> 0:46:52,2400
I'm gonna run.

972
0:46:52,2400 --> 0:46:53,2400
You're carrying him more.

973
0:46:53,2400 --> 0:46:54,2400
He's gonna find you.

974
0:46:54,2400 --> 0:46:55,2400
You're gonna find you.

975
0:46:55,2400 --> 0:46:56,2400
I'm gonna find you.

976
0:47:10,2400 --> 0:47:12,2400
We need a truck.

977
0:47:12,2400 --> 0:47:14,2400
Who is Eva?

978
0:47:14,2400 --> 0:47:15,2400
She's gone.

979
0:47:16,2400 --> 0:47:17,2400
Who is she?

980
0:47:17,2400 --> 0:47:18,2400
No.

981
0:47:18,2400 --> 0:47:19,2400
Who is she?

982
0:47:19,2400 --> 0:47:20,2400
No.

983
0:47:20,2400 --> 0:47:21,2400
Hey!

984
0:47:21,2400 --> 0:47:22,2400
Get in.

985
0:47:25,2400 --> 0:47:26,2400
Hey, are you okay?

986
0:47:26,2400 --> 0:47:27,2400
I'm here.

987
0:47:27,2400 --> 0:47:28,2400
Yeah.

988
0:47:28,2400 --> 0:47:29,2400
Okay.

989
0:47:33,2400 --> 0:47:35,2400
It's the third time you came back.

990
0:47:35,2400 --> 0:47:37,2400
You should be anyway.

991
0:47:37,2400 --> 0:47:38,2400
Okay?

992
0:47:38,2400 --> 0:47:39,2400
That's all.

993
0:47:41,2400 --> 0:47:42,2400
Oh, shit.

994
0:47:42,2400 --> 0:47:44,2400
I was going to talk to you.

995
0:47:44,2400 --> 0:47:45,2400
I'm sorry.

996
0:47:45,2400 --> 0:47:46,2400
I'm sorry.

997
0:47:51,2400 --> 0:47:52,2400
I didn't buy you stuff.

998
0:47:52,2400 --> 0:47:53,2400
So just...

999
0:47:53,2400 --> 0:47:54,2400
I heard a medical thing.

1000
0:47:54,2400 --> 0:47:56,2400
Did you get the word in the hospital?

1001
0:47:56,2400 --> 0:47:58,2400
Metal base set of north side.

1002
0:47:58,2400 --> 0:47:59,2400
No, I didn't pay you much of a price.

1003
0:47:59,2400 --> 0:48:01,2400
We were head not base.

1004
0:48:07,2400 --> 0:48:09,2400
I didn't buy you stuff.

1005
0:48:12,2400 --> 0:48:13,2400
No.

1006
0:48:13,2400 --> 0:48:14,2400
Wow.

1007
0:48:14,2400 --> 0:48:15,2400
Master of course.

1008
0:48:15,2400 --> 0:48:16,2400
Who get out of it?

1009
0:48:16,2400 --> 0:48:18,2400
Did I get it by yourself?

1010
0:48:18,2400 --> 0:48:19,2400
Now, so try to master.

1011
0:48:19,2400 --> 0:48:20,2400
I'm gonna go.

1012
0:48:43,2400 --> 0:48:44,2400
I'm about to get out.

1013
0:48:44,2400 --> 0:48:45,2400
Okay.

1014
0:48:45,2400 --> 0:48:46,2400
I'll be fired.

1015
0:48:46,2400 --> 0:48:49,2400
In this now, I want to pull it up.

1016
0:48:55,2400 --> 0:48:57,2400
How did you get out of it?

1017
0:48:57,2400 --> 0:48:59,2400
Where are that?

1018
0:48:59,2400 --> 0:49:00,2400
He's fired!

1019
0:49:00,2400 --> 0:49:01,2400
He's fired!

1020
0:49:07,2400 --> 0:49:08,2400
Come on.

1021
0:49:08,2400 --> 0:49:09,2400
Let's start.

1022
0:49:10,2400 --> 0:49:11,2400
Come on.

1023
0:49:11,2400 --> 0:49:12,2400
Let's go.

1024
0:49:12,2400 --> 0:49:13,2400
Come on.

1025
0:49:43,2400 --> 0:49:44,2400
Come on.

1026
0:50:03,2400 --> 0:50:04,2400
This is bad.

1027
0:50:12,2400 --> 0:50:19,2400
Now, I need you to connect your satellites.

1028
0:50:19,2400 --> 0:50:23,2400
I need to do it.

1029
0:50:23,2400 --> 0:50:26,2400
Okay, finally, where's the integration.

1030
0:50:26,2400 --> 0:50:29,2400
When I get my...

1031
0:50:29,2400 --> 0:50:30,2000
Are they...

1032
0:50:30,2000 --> 0:50:34,2400
Was this too licenses for additions?

1033
0:50:34,2400 --> 0:50:36,2400
Well, you know, I need to test it,

1034
0:50:36,2400 --> 0:50:38,2400
because on Twitch, wasn't any use of squares.

1035
0:50:38,2400 --> 0:50:41,2400
You can just sit around with your characterization.

1036
0:51:11,2400 --> 0:51:17,2400
She needs a scratch.

1037
0:51:17,2400 --> 0:51:19,2400
Oh, almost there.

1038
0:51:19,2400 --> 0:51:21,2400
That was her.

1039
0:51:21,2400 --> 0:51:22,2400
She did that to her.

1040
0:51:22,2400 --> 0:51:23,2400
She turned her tongue up.

1041
0:51:23,2400 --> 0:51:24,2400
Crucial.

1042
0:51:24,2400 --> 0:51:26,2400
You were right.

1043
0:51:26,2400 --> 0:51:28,2400
She definitely wanted us to get her.

1044
0:51:28,2400 --> 0:51:30,2400
To test on someone like that.

1045
0:51:30,2400 --> 0:51:31,2400
It's a shoe.

1046
0:51:31,2400 --> 0:51:32,2400
She lost it.

1047
0:51:32,2400 --> 0:51:33,2400
Nope.

1048
0:51:33,2400 --> 0:51:35,2400
She found it.

1049
0:51:35,2400 --> 0:51:37,2400
Who should use it?

1050
0:51:37,2400 --> 0:51:39,2400
What is this?

1051
0:51:39,2400 --> 0:51:44,2400
How does that explain for some gold or guardian of good?

1052
0:51:44,2400 --> 0:51:46,2400
It's an obstacle.

1053
0:51:46,2400 --> 0:51:49,2400
Well, a century.

1054
0:51:49,2400 --> 0:51:51,2400
Very shining.

1055
0:51:51,2400 --> 0:51:52,2400
I don't know.

1056
0:51:52,2400 --> 0:51:53,2400
Oh, what do you know about this?

1057
0:51:53,2400 --> 0:51:57,2400
There was a rumor, an oxalibersion kind of big breakthrough.

1058
0:51:57,2400 --> 0:51:58,2400
No, it wasn't.

1059
0:51:58,2400 --> 0:52:00,2400
We had to extreme test subjects for dying.

1060
0:52:00,2400 --> 0:52:02,2400
Government looked into it and I'll shut it down.

1061
0:52:02,2400 --> 0:52:04,2400
It should be a client day.

1062
0:52:04,2400 --> 0:52:06,2400
Let's just make it hard with that guy.

1063
0:52:06,2400 --> 0:52:07,2400
I'm crazy.

1064
0:52:07,2400 --> 0:52:09,2400
I just hate my neighbor homes.

1065
0:52:09,2400 --> 0:52:11,2400
Really hungry?

1066
0:52:11,2400 --> 0:52:13,2400
That was very...

1067
0:52:13,2400 --> 0:52:15,2400
It's very hard.

1068
0:52:15,2400 --> 0:52:21,2400
So, I will live back there today.

1069
0:52:21,2400 --> 0:52:23,2400
You have?

1070
0:52:23,2400 --> 0:52:25,2400
Yeah, I do.

1071
0:52:25,2400 --> 0:52:27,2400
She had a tough life.

1072
0:52:27,2400 --> 0:52:31,2400
She killed a lot of people and then she had killed.

1073
0:52:31,2400 --> 0:52:33,2400
Same as I someday.

1074
0:52:33,2400 --> 0:52:36,2400
It's a shit life.

1075
0:52:36,2400 --> 0:52:40,2400
Oh, I was at least doing a house before.

1076
0:52:40,2400 --> 0:52:42,2400
Oh, since the guy was in the living room,

1077
0:52:42,2400 --> 0:52:46,2400
well, that's how he lived for a long time.

1078
0:52:46,2400 --> 0:52:49,2400
No.

1079
0:52:49,2400 --> 0:52:54,2400
How you do it?

1080
0:52:54,2400 --> 0:52:58,2400
Let's keep working out every day.

1081
0:52:58,2400 --> 0:53:01,2400
Never get up.

1082
0:53:01,2400 --> 0:53:03,2400
Beautiful.

1083
0:53:04,2400 --> 0:53:07,2400
Dr. Vail, that was really beautiful.

1084
0:53:10,2400 --> 0:53:12,2400
You're a shes eye.

1085
0:53:12,2400 --> 0:53:14,2400
Yeah, do as I watch it.

1086
0:53:14,2400 --> 0:53:16,2400
I got cancer a few years ago.

1087
0:53:16,2400 --> 0:53:18,2400
It wasn't a good show.

1088
0:53:18,2400 --> 0:53:20,2400
It was a good show.

1089
0:53:20,2400 --> 0:53:22,2400
It was a good show.

1090
0:53:22,2400 --> 0:53:24,2400
Well, it isn't great.

1091
0:53:24,2400 --> 0:53:27,2400
Seven of the outlets of people's story of the last

1092
0:53:27,2400 --> 0:53:30,2400
one is already connected to the vault of Oax.

1093
0:53:30,2400 --> 0:53:33,2400
I was the first to be in the vault.

1094
0:53:33,2400 --> 0:53:36,2400
I was the first to be in the vault.

1095
0:53:36,2400 --> 0:53:39,2400
I was the first to be in the vault.

1096
0:53:39,2400 --> 0:53:42,2400
I was the first to be in the vault.

1097
0:53:42,2400 --> 0:53:45,2400
I was the first to be in the vault.

1098
0:53:45,2400 --> 0:53:48,2400
I was the first to be in the vault.

1099
0:53:48,2400 --> 0:53:51,2400
I was the first to be in the vault.

1100
0:53:51,2400 --> 0:53:54,2400
I was the first to be in the vault.

1101
0:53:54,2400 --> 0:53:57,2400
I was the first to be in the vault.

1102
0:53:57,2400 --> 0:54:00,2400
When you shut down the project, it's exactly where

1103
0:54:00,2400 --> 0:54:02,2400
it's exactly where officially it is.

1104
0:54:02,2400 --> 0:54:05,2400
What about the later and the others,

1105
0:54:05,2400 --> 0:54:07,2400
with the new yet,

1106
0:54:07,2400 --> 0:54:11,2400
get rid of the belt that the last piece had.

1107
0:54:11,2400 --> 0:54:14,2400
On it, letting them when they're going in the box,

1108
0:54:14,2400 --> 0:54:16,2400
gets new.

1109
0:54:28,2400 --> 0:54:30,2400
All right.

1110
0:54:30,2400 --> 0:54:33,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1111
0:54:33,2400 --> 0:54:36,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1112
0:54:36,2400 --> 0:54:38,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1113
0:54:38,2400 --> 0:54:40,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1114
0:54:40,2400 --> 0:54:42,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1115
0:54:42,2400 --> 0:54:45,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1116
0:54:45,2400 --> 0:54:48,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1117
0:54:48,2400 --> 0:54:51,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1118
0:54:51,2400 --> 0:54:54,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1119
0:54:54,2400 --> 0:54:56,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1120
0:54:57,2400 --> 0:54:59,2400
It's all right.

1121
0:55:05,2400 --> 0:55:08,2400
Oh no.

1122
0:55:08,2400 --> 0:55:11,2400
Let's go right house.

1123
0:55:11,2400 --> 0:55:12,2400
At least I am.

1124
0:55:12,2400 --> 0:55:14,2400
It is not one.

1125
0:55:14,2400 --> 0:55:15,2400
It's nothing.

1126
0:55:16,2400 --> 0:55:18,2400
It's nothing.

1127
0:55:24,2400 --> 0:55:26,2400
Come on guys.

1128
0:55:26,2400 --> 0:55:28,2400
Come on guys.

1129
0:55:28,2400 --> 0:55:30,2400
I'm not going to put your way to you.

1130
0:55:30,2400 --> 0:55:33,2400
Come on guys.

1131
0:55:33,2400 --> 0:55:34,2400
Come on guys.

1132
0:55:34,2400 --> 0:55:36,2400
Come on guys.

1133
0:55:36,2400 --> 0:55:39,2400
Come on guys.

1134
0:55:39,2400 --> 0:55:42,2400
Come on guys.

1135
0:55:42,2400 --> 0:55:44,2400
Come on guys.

I'm glad you're coming, I'm Captain America, you and I have loaded common, you know.

1146
0:56:18,5600 --> 0:56:23,2800
I do, but state sponsored super soldier in Russia.

1147
0:56:23,2800 --> 0:56:27,8000
But also, parent, they're right with his blogger, actually knows what he's doing.

1148
0:56:27,8000 --> 0:56:30,5600
Oh, I don't want to be judged, have you?

1149
0:56:30,5600 --> 0:56:36,6000
Disadmire, you're rare, painier, and you're reappeared, sometimes things pop up in right place.

1150
0:56:36,6000 --> 0:56:39,8400
No, I've made it best to do it in the war, and sometimes...

1151
0:56:39,8400 --> 0:56:41,4000
We're aggressive friends, do we?

1152
0:56:41,4000 --> 0:56:42,8000
We are aggressive.

1153
0:56:42,8400 --> 0:56:45,0400
No, just disposable telegrams.

1154
0:56:45,0400 --> 0:56:48,2000
Whatever you are, the light inside you's bright.

1155
0:56:50,4800 --> 0:56:51,7200
How about this?

1156
0:56:51,7200 --> 0:56:55,4800
You are a team of scrappy empty heroes.

1157
0:56:55,4800 --> 0:56:57,8400
You're like, go with 100 volts.

1158
0:56:57,8400 --> 0:56:59,4400
What?

1159
0:56:59,4400 --> 0:57:00,8400
Demand?

1160
0:57:00,8400 --> 0:57:02,4400
You make the most beautiful sound.

1161
0:57:02,4400 --> 0:57:03,2800
Make up?

1162
0:57:03,2800 --> 0:57:04,5200
Make up.

1163
0:57:04,5200 --> 0:57:10,6000
The West Jets of Big Mali, on the vault sponsored by Dimension Zelete, industrial lighting, and all that.

1164
0:57:10,6000 --> 0:57:15,2800
I'm sorry, never won a game, but you're in that so much...

1165
0:57:15,2800 --> 0:57:16,9600
There was a column pooped.

1166
0:57:16,9600 --> 0:57:17,9600
No, it wasn't.

1167
0:57:17,9600 --> 0:57:19,9600
It wasn't crazy.

1168
0:57:19,9600 --> 0:57:21,5600
It wasn't crazy.

1169
0:57:21,5600 --> 0:57:23,9600
It was sponsored by Shantyar.

1170
0:57:23,9600 --> 0:57:24,9600
Shantyar.

1171
0:57:24,9600 --> 0:57:25,9600
Yes.

1172
0:57:25,9600 --> 0:57:27,0400
What do you talk about?

1173
0:57:27,0400 --> 0:57:28,0400
It was...

1174
0:57:28,0400 --> 0:57:29,0400
It was not dependent on money.

1175
0:57:29,0400 --> 0:57:30,0400
It was.

1176
0:57:30,0400 --> 0:57:31,0400
No, Shant, what the...

1177
0:57:31,0400 --> 0:57:32,5600
You really need to sleep.

1178
0:57:32,5600 --> 0:57:34,3600
What the fuck about this bomb?

1179
0:57:34,3600 --> 0:57:35,3600
You bet.

1180
0:57:35,3600 --> 0:57:36,3600
What's the plan?

1181
0:57:36,3600 --> 0:57:37,3600
Where am I trying?

1182
0:57:37,3600 --> 0:57:38,3600
It's not like that.

1183
0:57:38,3600 --> 0:57:39,3600
We need to escape, and we need to hide.

1184
0:57:39,3600 --> 0:57:41
I always wanted to split up.

1185
0:57:41 --> 0:57:42,8400
It's actually an airfield not far from here.

1186
0:57:42,8400 --> 0:57:44,3200
We'll just disappear from there.

1187
0:57:44,3200 --> 0:57:45,3200
It's a bit hot.

1188
0:57:45,3200 --> 0:57:46,5600
No, no, no.

1189
0:57:46,5600 --> 0:57:50,2800
You may not see what I see, but I have been around a long time.

1190
0:57:50,2800 --> 0:57:56,2800
This has been making some teams that can race to the morning.

1191
0:57:56,2800 --> 0:57:59,8800
A team that can bring life from the dark.

1192
0:57:59,8800 --> 0:58:04,7600
A team of heroes that can be on the weakest spots.

1193
0:58:04,7600 --> 0:58:07,6000
And have little cheating on them.

1194
0:58:07,6000 --> 0:58:10,9200
No, this is not a marketing opportunity, okay?

1195
0:58:10,9200 --> 0:58:14
Valentina is hunting us, and we cannot win.

1196
0:58:14 --> 0:58:15
Do you understand?

1197
0:58:15 --> 0:58:17
I do, you don't.

1198
0:58:17 --> 0:58:18
You don't.

1199
0:58:18 --> 0:58:20
You don't say the Valentina's because you have the power of this century.

1200
0:58:20 --> 0:58:21
What?

1201
0:58:21 --> 0:58:22,4000
Take over and kill us all.

1202
0:58:22,4000 --> 0:58:23,4000
Yes.

1203
0:58:23,4000 --> 0:58:26,4000
You need to stand up to a new interior team.

1204
0:58:26,4000 --> 0:58:28,8000
You can't avoid approaching fast.

1205
0:58:28,8000 --> 0:58:29,8000
Step by it.

1206
0:58:30,2800 --> 0:58:34,5800
I can't因为 I have no chance to get out.

1207
0:58:34,5800 --> 0:58:37,5800
Move my feet.

1208
0:58:37,5800 --> 0:58:42,6200
Where do they get us?

1209
0:58:42,6200 --> 0:58:50,6200
Now, it's but me.

1210
0:58:50,6200 --> 0:58:58,1600
ienced in to one.

1211
0:58:58,1600 --> 0:59:00,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1212
0:59:00,1600 --> 0:59:02,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1213
0:59:02,1600 --> 0:59:04,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1214
0:59:04,1600 --> 0:59:06,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1215
0:59:06,1600 --> 0:59:08,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1216
0:59:08,1600 --> 0:59:10,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1217
0:59:10,1600 --> 0:59:12,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1218
0:59:12,1600 --> 0:59:14,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1219
0:59:14,1600 --> 0:59:16,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1220
0:59:16,1600 --> 0:59:18,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1221
0:59:18,1600 --> 0:59:20,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1222
0:59:20,1600 --> 0:59:22,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1223
0:59:22,1600 --> 0:59:24,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1224
0:59:24,1600 --> 0:59:26,1600
I'm gonna get pulled in

1225
0:59:26,1600 --> 0:59:28,1600
He's now throwing a grenade

1226
0:59:28,1600 --> 0:59:30,1600
Walk to the ground

1227
0:59:30,1600 --> 0:59:32,1600
And he's getting thrown off the ground

1228
0:59:32,1600 --> 0:59:34,1600
and he's getting thrown off the ground

1229
0:59:34,1600 --> 0:59:36,1600
Oh, I'm throwing

1230
0:59:42,1600 --> 0:59:44,1600
Oh, I'm throwing

1231
0:59:48,1600 --> 0:59:52,1600
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1232
0:59:52,1600 --> 0:59:54,1600
You're not playing.

1233
0:59:57,1600 --> 0:59:58,1600
Hey, hold it back.

1234
0:59:58,1600 --> 0:59:59,1600
Yeah, okay.

1235
0:59:59,1600 --> 1:00:00,1600
Get up.

1236
1:00:19,6400 --> 1:00:20,1600
Ahhhh!

1237
1:00:20,1600 --> 1:00:21,6400
That's not me ね!

1238
1:00:21,6400 --> 1:00:23,1600
The suspect is in there!

1239
1:00:29,1600 --> 1:00:38
upbeat music

1240
1:00:38 --> 1:00:39,1600
that's

1241
1:00:39,1600 --> 1:00:41,1600
man

1242
1:00:44,7400 --> 1:00:51,2400
talk

1243
1:00:53,9400 --> 1:00:58,0400
I am not a headed for soldier

1244
1:01:09,1600 --> 1:01:11,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1245
1:01:11,1600 --> 1:01:13,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1246
1:01:13,1600 --> 1:01:15,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1247
1:01:15,1600 --> 1:01:17,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1248
1:01:17,1600 --> 1:01:19,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1249
1:01:19,1600 --> 1:01:21,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1250
1:01:21,1600 --> 1:01:23,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1251
1:01:23,1600 --> 1:01:25,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1252
1:01:25,1600 --> 1:01:27,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1253
1:01:27,1600 --> 1:01:29,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1254
1:01:29,1600 --> 1:01:31,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1255
1:01:31,1600 --> 1:01:33,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1256
1:01:33,1600 --> 1:01:35,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1257
1:01:35,1600 --> 1:01:37,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1258
1:01:37,1600 --> 1:01:38,1600
I'm not going to let you down.

1259
1:01:38,1600 --> 1:01:40,1600
Got my phone!

1260
1:01:40,1600 --> 1:01:42,1600
Ok my phone!

1261
1:01:44,1600 --> 1:01:46,1600
Ok my phone!

1262
1:01:46,1600 --> 1:01:48,1600
That's one that won't help!

1263
1:01:48,1600 --> 1:01:50,2400
Nooo!

1264
1:01:52,2400 --> 1:01:54,1600
kilometers!

1265
1:01:54,1600 --> 1:01:56,1600
Yeah!

1266
1:01:56,1600 --> 1:01:58,1600
No!

1267
1:02:04,1600 --> 1:02:06,1600
By exemple hey until 10 to 15 minutes earlier.

1268
1:02:06,1600 --> 1:02:08,4000
And I'm dear, yeah, it's a cold and emotional recession.

1269
1:02:08,4000 --> 1:02:09,8000
I'm being impeachment for many.

1270
1:02:09,8000 --> 1:02:12,6000
What I can say is that I've got the tip of a trust in cohort

1271
1:02:12,6000 --> 1:02:14,8000
that will be bringing something new under the density.

1272
1:02:14,8000 --> 1:02:15,8000
And that evidence is,

1273
1:02:15,8000 --> 1:02:18,6800
juicy impeachment was just an appetizer.

1274
1:02:18,6800 --> 1:02:20,7600
This should be getting a nice, cozy self.

1275
1:02:20,7600 --> 1:02:22,8800
I'm talking with prison ready for Ms. Fountain,

1276
1:02:22,8800 --> 1:02:23,7200
today here.

1277
1:02:23,7200 --> 1:02:24,9200
I'm waiting for your call.

1278
1:02:24,9200 --> 1:02:26,9200
We're the impeachment committees committee tonight.

1279
1:02:26,9200 --> 1:02:28,0800
This is serious, though.

1280
1:02:28,0800 --> 1:02:30,5600
We're able to get the land fully operational.

1281
1:02:30,5600 --> 1:02:33,5200
Yes, but the rest of the building is only some even some finish.

1282
1:02:33,5200 --> 1:02:35,8000
OK, now we'll get it there.

1283
1:02:35,8000 --> 1:02:37,2000
Welcome to the watch now.

1284
1:02:41,2000 --> 1:02:43,6800
Val, something happened in Malaysia.

1285
1:02:43,6800 --> 1:02:47,0400
Having brought his file, delusions of anger, depression,

1286
1:02:47,0400 --> 1:02:51,2800
and some of that, the avalanche, amplified by the treatment.

1287
1:02:51,2800 --> 1:02:54,9200
She bought a whole mass, and she was just testing checks.

1288
1:02:54,9200 --> 1:02:56,4800
You're never going to be the one.

1289
1:02:56,4800 --> 1:02:57,9200
Does this not nurture enough?

1290
1:03:00,8800 --> 1:03:01,6800
Very nutrient.

1291
1:03:06,8000 --> 1:03:07,8000
Hi.

1292
1:03:07,8000 --> 1:03:10,7600
How are you feeling, Robert?

1293
1:03:10,7600 --> 1:03:13,4800
You're comfortable?

1294
1:03:13,4800 --> 1:03:14,4800
Hello.

1295
1:03:14,4800 --> 1:03:19,1600
My name is Valentina Allegro de Fontaine.

1296
1:03:19,1600 --> 1:03:20,2000
No, no, no.

1297
1:03:20,2000 --> 1:03:21,4400
You tried to kill us.

1298
1:03:21,4400 --> 1:03:22,4400
She's here.

1299
1:03:22,4400 --> 1:03:23,4400
She's here.

1300
1:03:27,4400 --> 1:03:28,3600
Let me explain.

1301
1:03:28,3600 --> 1:03:31,8400
Would you like that?

1302
1:03:31,8400 --> 1:03:34,4800
You signed up for a medical study,

1303
1:03:34,4800 --> 1:03:39,6400
which was as advertised at the cutting edge of human improvement.

1304
1:03:39,6400 --> 1:03:42,6000
But not everybody could handle the amount of greatness

1305
1:03:42,6000 --> 1:03:43,8000
that we had in Mali.

1306
1:03:43,8000 --> 1:03:45,9600
I couldn't do you, Elena.

1307
1:03:45,9600 --> 1:03:47,0400
Elena?

1308
1:03:47,0400 --> 1:03:48,0400
No.

1309
1:03:48,0400 --> 1:03:51,1600
Those people you were with, those are not honest people.

1310
1:03:51,1600 --> 1:03:52,5600
They're criminals.

1311
1:03:52,5600 --> 1:03:54,0400
Villains, really.

1312
1:03:54,0400 --> 1:03:54,7200
Yeah.

1313
1:03:54,7200 --> 1:03:56,4000
No, they helped me.

1314
1:03:59,4400 --> 1:04:00,9600
Hard.

1315
1:04:00,9600 --> 1:04:02,1600
Let's just forget about them.

1316
1:04:02,1600 --> 1:04:04,6400
Let's focus on you.

1317
1:04:04,6400 --> 1:04:08,5600
And have a perfecting of our.

1318
1:04:08,5600 --> 1:04:09,6000
Perfect.

1319
1:04:09,6000 --> 1:04:12,8800
You always thought of yourself as a victim,

1320
1:04:12,8800 --> 1:04:14,9200
but you overcame.

1321
1:04:14,9200 --> 1:04:16,5200
You went to Malaysia.

1322
1:04:16,5200 --> 1:04:17,6000
You were lost, right?

1323
1:04:17,6000 --> 1:04:20,0400
You were searching.

1324
1:04:20,0400 --> 1:04:23,2800
And you found me.

1325
1:04:23,2800 --> 1:04:24,5600
How do you know all of that?

1326
1:04:24,5600 --> 1:04:25,7600
I know all of it.

1327
1:04:25,7600 --> 1:04:28,0400
I know about your mom's mental illness.

1328
1:04:28,0400 --> 1:04:30,8800
I know about your addiction and your juvenile

1329
1:04:30,8800 --> 1:04:31,8800
record.

1330
1:04:31,8800 --> 1:04:34,7200
I even know about the times your father stopped.

1331
1:04:34,7200 --> 1:04:35,7200
No.

1332
1:04:35,7200 --> 1:04:36,7200
No, no.

1333
1:04:36,7200 --> 1:04:39,9200
How am I didn't say you could know that?

1334
1:04:39,9200 --> 1:04:42,8400
Robert, I know everything about you.

1335
1:04:42,8400 --> 1:04:47,5600
And I still want you to be like I.

1336
1:04:47,5600 --> 1:04:53,4400
And as in that way, one, to be accepted, to be chosen.

1337
1:04:53,4400 --> 1:04:55,9600
Now, it's not season.

1338
1:04:55,9600 --> 1:04:57,8000
But I am.

1339
1:04:57,8000 --> 1:05:00,2000
And I think maybe your parents always

1340
1:05:00,2800 --> 1:05:01,6000
makes you supagal.

1341
1:05:01,6000 --> 1:05:02,2800
Hurt.

1342
1:05:10,8800 --> 1:05:12,4800
Sir, please save Jimmy TV.

1343
1:05:12,4800 --> 1:05:13,7600
Please, please, please.

1344
1:05:13,7600 --> 1:05:15,2400
I think so enough, Craig.

1345
1:05:15,2400 --> 1:05:16,4400
All right.

1346
1:05:17,2400 --> 1:05:25,9600
Chad, will you wait?

1347
1:05:25,9600 --> 1:05:26,6000
gruppiya soo

1348
1:05:28,7600 --> 1:05:29,5800
this fetish.

1349
1:05:29,5800 --> 1:05:32,0200
Okay, I'll find out.

1350
1:05:38,8400 --> 1:05:42,1200
Hi, how are you feeling?

1351
1:05:45,4000 --> 1:05:47,1600
Mm hmm

1352
1:05:48,4000 --> 1:05:50,5800
Don't you know you're hurt right here and this is you.

1353
1:05:55,8800 --> 1:05:57,6400
Hmmhmmm your fucking ankle got you.

1354
1:05:59,5800 --> 1:06:09,5800
What do you excuse me just for a moment?

1355
1:06:09,5800 --> 1:06:19,5800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1356
1:06:19,5800 --> 1:06:27,5800
I get control.

1357
1:06:28,5800 --> 1:06:34,5800
Craig?

1358
1:06:34,5800 --> 1:06:37,5800
Alright, let's get the press here.

1359
1:06:37,5800 --> 1:06:40,5800
In the morning, it's time to show up when I be working out.

1360
1:06:40,5800 --> 1:06:43,5800
Yeah, you put a serum into someone next to your brother.

1361
1:06:43,5800 --> 1:06:45,5800
He becomes Captain America.

1362
1:06:45,5800 --> 1:06:50,5800
But to disillusion this unstable, we know what it did to him.

1363
1:06:50,5800 --> 1:06:52,5800
That's why we built a safe guard.

1364
1:06:52,5800 --> 1:06:53,5800
Make a kill switch?

1365
1:06:53,5800 --> 1:06:57,5800
Yeah, but we throw it out along with everything else.

1366
1:06:57,5800 --> 1:06:59,5800
Well, then we make it.

1367
1:06:59,5800 --> 1:07:02,5800
I don't really care who this guy was.

1368
1:07:02,5800 --> 1:07:06,5800
I do know what he can't come.

1369
1:07:06,5800 --> 1:07:18,5800
Get the press here like I asked.

1370
1:07:18,5800 --> 1:07:20,5800
Oh no, no, no!

1371
1:07:20,5800 --> 1:07:27,5800
Just when they get my team together, we just want you to make an terrible mistake.

1372
1:07:27,5800 --> 1:07:29,5800
Serif, that's me.

1373
1:07:29,5800 --> 1:07:30,5800
What committee?

1374
1:07:30,5800 --> 1:07:34,5800
You're all evidence in the impeachment trial against Valentina.

1375
1:07:34,5800 --> 1:07:36,5800
There are even lots of Valentina anymore.

1376
1:07:36,5800 --> 1:07:37,5800
She tried to kill us.

1377
1:07:37,5800 --> 1:07:41,5800
Your order to destroy all the secrets really was sent to Kelly Trion's vault.

1378
1:07:41,5800 --> 1:07:43,5800
But then we met Bog.

1379
1:07:43,5800 --> 1:07:45,5800
There was a man in the vault.

1380
1:07:45,5800 --> 1:07:47,5800
She's done something to him.

1381
1:07:47,5800 --> 1:07:49,5800
He was a real project sentry.

1382
1:07:49,5800 --> 1:07:50,5800
And he shot into the sky.

1383
1:07:50,5800 --> 1:07:51,5800
He exploded.

1384
1:07:51,5800 --> 1:07:53,5800
And then he crashed into his mountain.

1385
1:07:53,5800 --> 1:07:54,5800
And then he died.

1386
1:07:54,5800 --> 1:07:55,5800
Didn't die.

1387
1:07:55,5800 --> 1:07:56,5800
Yes, I died.

1388
1:07:56,5800 --> 1:07:57,5800
It was very, very scary.

1389
1:07:57,5800 --> 1:07:58,5800
Okay.

1390
1:07:58,5800 --> 1:08:00,5800
Congressman Barnes.

1391
1:08:00,5800 --> 1:08:03,5800
All right, Walker.

1392
1:08:03,5800 --> 1:08:06,5800
I'm so supposed to know.

1393
1:08:06,5800 --> 1:08:08,5800
He's gonna be lucky.

1394
1:08:08,5800 --> 1:08:10,5800
So cut the shit and listen to what we're trying to tell you.

1395
1:08:10,5800 --> 1:08:12,5800
Yeah, how you going, John?

1396
1:08:12,5800 --> 1:08:14,5800
And you made your chances.

1397
1:08:14,5800 --> 1:08:17,5800
And how it's been arson, so let me left you and took your kid, but still.

1398
1:08:17,5800 --> 1:08:20,5800
This is on you.

1399
1:08:20,5800 --> 1:08:24,5800
I think that won't be a committee match.

1400
1:08:24,5800 --> 1:08:27,5800
But here, I don't even be a government.

1401
1:08:27,5800 --> 1:08:28,5800
She has some big.

1402
1:08:28,5800 --> 1:08:29,5800
Correct.

1403
1:08:29,5800 --> 1:08:32,5800
Yes, I got named Bob or sentry who flies.

1404
1:08:32,5800 --> 1:08:33,5800
Right?

1405
1:08:33,5800 --> 1:08:34,5800
And you're all here.

1406
1:08:34,5800 --> 1:08:36,5800
I was going after a pal ready to save the day.

1407
1:08:36,5800 --> 1:08:37,5800
I was just going to go there.

1408
1:08:37,5800 --> 1:08:38,5800
Yeah, there to go.

1409
1:08:38,5800 --> 1:08:40,5800
They're just trying to get the home alive, actually.

1410
1:08:40,5800 --> 1:08:41,5800
That's even more pathetic.

1411
1:08:41,5800 --> 1:08:43,5800
You know, I'm a little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little.

1412
1:08:44,5800 --> 1:08:45,5800
All right.

1413
1:08:45,5800 --> 1:08:47,5800
My land's in six minutes.

1414
1:08:47,5800 --> 1:08:48,5800
Yes.

1415
1:08:48,5800 --> 1:08:50,5800
Bucky, I need your help.

1416
1:08:50,5800 --> 1:08:51,5800
What is it?

1417
1:08:51,5800 --> 1:08:53,5800
Well, his, oh, the rails.

1418
1:08:53,5800 --> 1:08:55,5800
I mean, project's entry.

1419
1:08:55,5800 --> 1:08:57,5800
It's not just any earlier. It's dangerous.

1420
1:08:57,5800 --> 1:08:58,5800
Project's entry.

1421
1:08:58,5800 --> 1:08:59,5800
Where it's at?

1422
1:09:00,5800 --> 1:09:02,5800
She has turned to power in her hands.

1423
1:09:02,5800 --> 1:09:05,5800
And this guy is a disaster waiting to happen.

1424
1:09:05,5800 --> 1:09:06,5800
What going?

1425
1:09:06,5800 --> 1:09:07,5800
Bob.

1426
1:09:07,5800 --> 1:09:08,5800
Bob.

1427
1:09:08,5800 --> 1:09:09,5800
Bob.

1428
1:09:09,5800 --> 1:09:10,5800
Bob.

1429
1:09:10,5800 --> 1:09:14,5800
The breath of interest makes the pressures have to come tomorrow morning.

1430
1:09:14,5800 --> 1:09:16,5800
Someone has to do something.

1431
1:09:16,5800 --> 1:09:17,5800
Shit.

1432
1:09:17,5800 --> 1:09:18,5800
Okay.

1433
1:09:18,5800 --> 1:09:19,5800
I have to go.

1434
1:09:19,5800 --> 1:09:20,5800
But come now.

1435
1:09:20,5800 --> 1:09:21,5800
Please.

1436
1:09:21,5800 --> 1:09:22,5800
Bring anyone.

1437
1:09:30,5800 --> 1:09:31,5800
Bob.

1438
1:09:31,5800 --> 1:09:32,5800
Bob.

1439
1:09:32,5800 --> 1:09:35,5800
How many times?

1440
1:09:35,5800 --> 1:09:36,5800
It's bad.

1441
1:09:36,5800 --> 1:09:37,5800
Bucky.

1442
1:09:41,5800 --> 1:09:43,5800
What are you doing?

1443
1:09:43,5800 --> 1:09:44,5800
Why are you doing this?

1444
1:09:44,5800 --> 1:09:45,5800
You're coming.

1445
1:09:45,5800 --> 1:09:46,5800
Why?

1446
1:09:46,5800 --> 1:09:47,5800
Shhh.

1447
1:09:47,5800 --> 1:09:49,5800
Forty-poori.

1448
1:09:49,5800 --> 1:09:51,5800
Well, you know what balance here.

1449
1:09:51,5800 --> 1:09:53,5800
She's got this thing out there.

1450
1:09:53,5800 --> 1:09:55,5800
People are going to hit her.

1451
1:09:55,5800 --> 1:09:57,5800
And I've got to stop you.

1452
1:09:57,5800 --> 1:09:58,5800
Now.

1453
1:09:58,5800 --> 1:09:59,5800
Wait.

1454
1:09:59,5800 --> 1:10:00,5800
Us?

1455
1:10:00,5800 --> 1:10:03,5800
Why, you get some place to be.

1456
1:10:03,5800 --> 1:10:05,5800
Not you with the wrong people.

1457
1:10:05,5800 --> 1:10:08,5800
Look, I've done what you want.

1458
1:10:08,5800 --> 1:10:11,5800
You can run, but it doesn't go away.

1459
1:10:11,5800 --> 1:10:16,5800
Sooner or later, it catches up to you when it does since two days.

1460
1:10:16,5800 --> 1:10:20,5800
So you can do something about it now.

1461
1:10:20,5800 --> 1:10:23,5800
We'll live with it forever.

1462
1:10:23,5800 --> 1:10:34,5800
I'm still alive from the same moment.

1463
1:10:34,5800 --> 1:10:39,5800
I'm still alive from the same moment.

1464
1:10:39,5800 --> 1:10:40,5800
I know.

1465
1:10:40,5800 --> 1:10:41,5800
I know.

1466
1:10:41,5800 --> 1:10:43,5800
But you're still alive.

1467
1:10:43,5800 --> 1:10:44,5800
I know.

1468
1:10:44,5800 --> 1:10:45,5800
I know.

1469
1:10:45,5800 --> 1:10:46,5800
The same moment.

1470
1:10:46,5800 --> 1:10:47,5800
I know.

1471
1:10:47,5800 --> 1:10:48,5800
I know.

1472
1:10:48,5800 --> 1:10:49,5800
I know.

1473
1:10:49,5800 --> 1:10:50,5800
I know.

1474
1:10:50,5800 --> 1:10:52,5800
I'm calling him.

1475
1:10:52,5800 --> 1:10:54,5800
No!

1476
1:10:56,5800 --> 1:10:58,5800
No!

1477
1:10:58,5800 --> 1:11:00,5800
No!

1478
1:11:04,5800 --> 1:11:06,5800
What do you think this job is gonna be?

1479
1:11:08,5800 --> 1:11:12,5800
I'm only hope I've done something good.

1480
1:11:12,5800 --> 1:11:14,5800
Good.

1481
1:11:14,5800 --> 1:11:16,5800
Good girl.

1482
1:11:16,5800 --> 1:11:18,5800
Good enough.

1483
1:11:18,5800 --> 1:11:20,5800
You wanna be good?

1484
1:11:20,5800 --> 1:11:22,5800
Or do you wanna be somebody who changes the world?

1485
1:11:22,5800 --> 1:11:24,5800
Can it be oath?

1486
1:11:24,5800 --> 1:11:28,5800
I mean, I thought you wanted to change the world for the better too.

1487
1:11:28,5800 --> 1:11:32,5800
Now, righteousness without power is just an opinion.

1488
1:11:32,5800 --> 1:11:38,5800
Look, you're brought up to believe that there's a good guy and a bad guy.

1489
1:11:38,5800 --> 1:11:46,5800
And then eventually you come to realize that there's a bad guy and a worse guy.

1490
1:11:46,5800 --> 1:11:48,5800
And nothing else.

1491
1:11:48,5800 --> 1:11:52,5800
Well, you know, when you come to your senses, I...

1492
1:11:58,5800 --> 1:12:00,5800
You know, I'm pretty well.

1493
1:12:00,5800 --> 1:12:02,5800
Okay, no. I'm just trying again.

1494
1:12:02,5800 --> 1:12:04,5800
Yeah.

1495
1:12:04,5800 --> 1:12:06,5800
Let's just know that it's...

1496
1:12:06,5800 --> 1:12:08,5800
I believe in you.

1497
1:12:16,5800 --> 1:12:18,5800
I...

1498
1:12:32,5800 --> 1:12:34,5800
I do.

1499
1:12:34,5800 --> 1:12:38,5800
You can do anything.

1500
1:12:38,5800 --> 1:12:40,5800
People think they know you.

1501
1:12:40,5800 --> 1:12:42,5800
They just see you as a daughter.

1502
1:12:42,5800 --> 1:12:44,5800
They pity Bob.

1503
1:12:44,5800 --> 1:12:50,5800
I'm the only one who knows what your true potential is from.

1504
1:12:50,5800 --> 1:12:54,5800
It has limitless.

1505
1:12:54,5800 --> 1:12:58,5800
Ready for the next lesson?

1506
1:12:58,5800 --> 1:13:04,5800
I'm the only one who knows what your true potential is from.

1507
1:13:04,5800 --> 1:13:10,5800
I'm the only one who knows what your true potential is from.

1508
1:13:10,5800 --> 1:13:16,5800
I'm the only one who knows what your true potential is from.

1509
1:13:16,5800 --> 1:13:18,5800
And then I have this little window,

1510
1:13:18,5800 --> 1:13:20,5800
it's not thick, I mean.

1511
1:13:20,5800 --> 1:13:22,5800
I'm not really.

1512
1:13:22,5800 --> 1:13:26,5800
And then I have this 19.

1513
1:13:26,5800 --> 1:13:28,5800
It's a little one.

1514
1:13:28,5800 --> 1:13:32,5800
And now, you're one of out your hat.

1515
1:13:32,5800 --> 1:13:34,5800
You have it?

1516
1:13:34,5800 --> 1:13:36,5800
You'll never even want to call it.

1517
1:13:36,5800 --> 1:13:38,5800
You're like...

1518
1:13:38,5800 --> 1:13:40,5800
You're like...

1519
1:13:40,5800 --> 1:13:44,5800
Yeah, that's pretty true.

1520
1:13:44,5800 --> 1:13:46,5800
Then what?

1521
1:13:46,5800 --> 1:13:48,5800
The Christmas too soon.

1522
1:13:48,5800 --> 1:13:50,5800
I don't know. Regular.

1523
1:13:50,5800 --> 1:13:52,5800
I don't know.

1524
1:13:52,5800 --> 1:13:56,5800
I was so mean to be creation, but the super...

1525
1:13:56,5800 --> 1:14:00,5800
We are saying, you and me.

1526
1:14:00,5800 --> 1:14:02,5800
We are different, but we are different.

1527
1:14:02,5800 --> 1:14:04,5800
We could be cosy this.

1528
1:14:04,5800 --> 1:14:06,5800
Well, you get tired.

1529
1:14:06,5800 --> 1:14:08,5800
I drive.

1530
1:14:08,5800 --> 1:14:10,5800
I don't get tired.

1531
1:14:10,5800 --> 1:14:12,5800
No, I'm in this corner.

1532
1:14:12,5800 --> 1:14:14,5800
I don't actually want people to have.

1533
1:14:14,5800 --> 1:14:16,5800
Almost!

1534
1:14:16,5800 --> 1:14:18,5800
Okay.

1535
1:14:18,5800 --> 1:14:22,5800
Mr. Sonser, what is secret?

1536
1:14:22,5800 --> 1:14:24,5800
Plan.

1537
1:14:24,5800 --> 1:14:26,5800
Plan.

1538
1:14:38,5800 --> 1:14:40,5800
I like this!

1539
1:14:48,5800 --> 1:14:50,5800
I don't need this super guard.

1540
1:14:50,5800 --> 1:14:52,5800
I'm literally just a little driving all the time.

1541
1:14:52,5800 --> 1:14:54,5800
I've left the door unlocked for you.

1542
1:14:54,5800 --> 1:14:56,5800
Come on up.

1543
1:14:56,5800 --> 1:14:58,5800
Okay.

1544
1:14:58,5800 --> 1:15:00,5800
Okay.

1545
1:15:00,5800 --> 1:15:02,5800
Okay.

1546
1:15:02,5800 --> 1:15:04,5800
Okay.

1547
1:15:04,5800 --> 1:15:06,5800
Okay.

1548
1:15:06,5800 --> 1:15:08,5800
Okay.

1549
1:15:08,5800 --> 1:15:10,5800
Okay.

1550
1:15:10,5800 --> 1:15:12,5800
I think it's a super guard.

1551
1:15:12,5800 --> 1:15:14,5800
I know that he just just opened his backpack.

1552
1:15:14,5800 --> 1:15:16,5800
I drive all the time.

1553
1:15:16,5800 --> 1:15:17,7400
three, eight, come up.

1554
1:15:35,1800 --> 1:15:39,2600
How crazy is it to think of all the monumental fights

1555
1:15:39,2600 --> 1:15:41,9800
that happen exactly here where you're sent?

1556
1:15:44,7000 --> 1:15:45,7800
I don't know, we care.

1557
1:15:46,5800 --> 1:15:49,7400
I mean, the place wasn't cheap, but it's got good options.

1558
1:15:49,7400 --> 1:15:51,6600
That's all we're about, you know?

1559
1:15:51,6600 --> 1:15:53,0600
The sense today.

1560
1:15:53,0600 --> 1:15:54,3400
Congress moved bars.

1561
1:15:54,3400 --> 1:15:55,1000
Wow.

1562
1:15:55,1000 --> 1:15:56,9800
You know, I never really thought you'd have

1563
1:15:56,9800 --> 1:16:01,9000
promising political career, but less than half a term.

1564
1:16:01,9000 --> 1:16:03,9000
Yikes.

1565
1:16:03,9000 --> 1:16:04,2200
Okay.

1566
1:16:04,2200 --> 1:16:05,7400
Yeah, no.

1567
1:16:06,7400 --> 1:16:08,2600
I don't think so.

1568
1:16:08,2600 --> 1:16:11,7400
Generosity, Captain America.

1569
1:16:11,7400 --> 1:16:12,7400
Walker.

1570
1:16:13,7400 --> 1:16:16,7400
Now nice to see you, Ava.

1571
1:16:16,7400 --> 1:16:20,7400
Elena, you look awful.

1572
1:16:20,7400 --> 1:16:24,7400
You sure you're really ready for that public facing goal?

1573
1:16:24,7400 --> 1:16:26,7400
It's shit, though, Dina.

1574
1:16:26,7400 --> 1:16:27,7400
Bush, both.

1575
1:16:27,7400 --> 1:16:28,7400
Look at you.

1576
1:16:28,7400 --> 1:16:31,7400
You are all so adorable.

1577
1:16:31,7400 --> 1:16:34,7400
Just think I send you down there to Kelly Chappell,

1578
1:16:34,7400 --> 1:16:38,7400
and instead you make nice and uniform a team.

1579
1:16:38,7400 --> 1:16:41,7400
Who is this old Santa?

1580
1:16:41,7400 --> 1:16:45,7400
I'm actually sure it's the call.

1581
1:16:45,7400 --> 1:16:48,7400
The Red Guardian.

1582
1:16:48,7400 --> 1:16:50,7400
What?

1583
1:16:50,7400 --> 1:16:51,7400
Where's now?

1584
1:16:51,7400 --> 1:16:52,7400
Mal.

1585
1:16:52,7400 --> 1:16:53,7400
Oh, Mal.

1586
1:16:53,7400 --> 1:16:54,7400
Yeah.

1587
1:16:54,7400 --> 1:17:01,2200
Mal is having a little loyalty issue, but I'm just so grateful that she stayed long enough

1588
1:17:01,2200 --> 1:17:04,2200
to lure you all in.

1589
1:17:04,2200 --> 1:17:09,2200
I'm not alone.

1590
1:17:09,2200 --> 1:17:14,2200
Robert.

1591
1:17:14,2200 --> 1:17:18,2200
Oh, my God.

1592
1:17:18,2200 --> 1:17:19,2200
That's hot.

1593
1:17:19,2200 --> 1:17:23,2200
Yeah, he's changed so little.

1594
1:17:23,2200 --> 1:17:30,2200
It is my great honor to entrusting CEO, the centric.

1595
1:17:30,2200 --> 1:17:32,2200
Hey, guys.

1596
1:17:32,2200 --> 1:17:33,2200
Wow.

1597
1:17:33,2200 --> 1:17:35,2200
That's cool, man.

1598
1:17:35,2200 --> 1:17:41,2200
It's so powerful, invincible, stronger than all of the Avengers rolled into one,

1599
1:17:41,2200 --> 1:17:47,2200
and soon to be known as Earth's mightiest hero.

1600
1:17:47,2200 --> 1:17:50,2200
How many times will I have?

1601
1:17:50,2200 --> 1:17:51,2200
Yeah, well, it was.

1602
1:17:51,2200 --> 1:17:53,2200
Yeah, it was my idea.

1603
1:17:53,2200 --> 1:17:56,2200
People love a classic hero.

1604
1:17:56,2200 --> 1:17:57,2200
Okay, I'll buy.

1605
1:17:57,2200 --> 1:17:58,2200
What's the plan?

1606
1:17:58,2200 --> 1:18:00,2200
Yeah, I'm figured it out yet.

1607
1:18:00,2200 --> 1:18:02,2200
Bucket changed.

1608
1:18:02,2200 --> 1:18:03,2200
At least you're kind of cute.

1609
1:18:03,2200 --> 1:18:05,2200
I'm not going to hurt you.

1610
1:18:05,2200 --> 1:18:06,2200
Oh, no.

1611
1:18:06,2200 --> 1:18:08,2200
No, I'm not going to hurt people.

1612
1:18:08,2200 --> 1:18:10,2200
I'm going to hurt you.

1613
1:18:10,2200 --> 1:18:13,2200
You see, the press is on their way here now.

1614
1:18:13,2200 --> 1:18:20,2200
They're going to witness the awesome power of the century as he takes down this ruthless group of rogue agents,

1615
1:18:20,2200 --> 1:18:26,2200
thus beginning a new era in which I decide how to keep the American people safe,

1616
1:18:26,2200 --> 1:18:29,2200
answering to no one.

1617
1:18:29,2200 --> 1:18:32,2200
I'll be un-in-peachable.

1618
1:18:32,2200 --> 1:18:36,2200
That's never going to happen.

1619
1:18:36,2200 --> 1:18:42,2200
Centri, your first mission is to take out these criminals.

1620
1:18:42,2200 --> 1:18:47,2200
I don't want to hurt you guys.

1621
1:18:47,2200 --> 1:18:51,2200
Well, you just turn yourselves in.

1622
1:18:51,2200 --> 1:18:54,2200
I don't know what you don't want to do as a bugger.

1623
1:18:54,2200 --> 1:18:56,2200
You can call me Centri.

1624
1:18:56,2200 --> 1:18:57,2200
Please, don't do this.

1625
1:18:57,2200 --> 1:18:59,2200
You don't get to listen to her.

1626
1:18:59,2200 --> 1:19:01,2200
Robert, they don't think you're good enough.

1627
1:19:01,2200 --> 1:19:02,2200
That's not true.

1628
1:19:02,2200 --> 1:19:03,2200
Remember?

1629
1:19:03,2200 --> 1:19:04,2200
You can trust me.

1630
1:19:04,2200 --> 1:19:05,2200
I know you.

1631
1:19:07,2200 --> 1:19:10,2200
I don't think you need to.

1632
1:19:12,2200 --> 1:19:14,2200
Enough talking!

1633
1:19:14,2200 --> 1:19:19,2200
No one misses with your worst, chess of big belly.

1634
1:19:19,2200 --> 1:19:21,2200
Find them all!

1635
1:19:21,2200 --> 1:19:23,2200
Thank you, Robert.

1636
1:19:23,2200 --> 1:19:25,2200
Oh, no!

1637
1:19:25,2200 --> 1:19:26,2200
Hey!

1638
1:19:26,2200 --> 1:19:27,2200
Look at that!

1639
1:19:27,2200 --> 1:19:28,2200
Hey!

1640
1:19:28,2200 --> 1:19:29,2200
Look at that!

1641
1:19:32,2200 --> 1:19:33,2200
Hey!

1642
1:19:33,2200 --> 1:19:34,2200
Oh, no!

1643
1:19:42,2200 --> 1:19:43,2200
I'm asking why!

1644
1:19:58,2200 --> 1:19:59,2200
Oh!

1645
1:19:59,2200 --> 1:20:00,2200
Oh!

1646
1:20:00,2200 --> 1:20:03,2200
I'm struggling to...

1647
1:20:03,2200 --> 1:20:05,2200
Stop!

1648
1:20:05,2200 --> 1:20:07,2200
Stop!

1649
1:20:07,2200 --> 1:20:09,2200
Stop!

1650
1:20:09,2200 --> 1:20:11,2200
Stop!

1651
1:20:11,2200 --> 1:20:13,2200
Stop!

1652
1:20:13,2200 --> 1:20:15,2200
Stop!

1653
1:20:15,2200 --> 1:20:17,2200
Stop!

1654
1:20:17,2200 --> 1:20:19,2200
Stop!

1655
1:20:19,2200 --> 1:20:21,2200
Stop!

1656
1:20:21,2200 --> 1:20:23,2200
Stop!

1657
1:20:23,2200 --> 1:20:25,2200
Stop!

1658
1:20:25,2200 --> 1:20:26,2200
Stop!

1659
1:20:26,2200 --> 1:20:28,2200
Stop!

1660
1:20:28,2200 --> 1:20:30,2200
Stop!

1661
1:20:40,2200 --> 1:20:42,2200
Stop!

1662
1:20:42,2200 --> 1:20:44,2200
Stop!

1663
1:20:44,2200 --> 1:20:46,2200
Stop!

1664
1:20:56,2200 --> 1:20:58,2200
Stop!

1665
1:20:58,2200 --> 1:21:00,2200
Stop!

1666
1:21:00,2200 --> 1:21:02,2200
Stop!

1667
1:21:02,2200 --> 1:21:04,2200
Stop!

1668
1:21:04,2200 --> 1:21:06,2200
Stop!

1669
1:21:06,2200 --> 1:21:08,2200
Stop!

1670
1:21:08,2200 --> 1:21:10,2200
Stop!

1671
1:21:10,2200 --> 1:21:12,2200
Stop!

1672
1:21:12,2200 --> 1:21:14,2200
Stop!

1673
1:21:14,2200 --> 1:21:16,2200
Stop!

1674
1:21:16,2200 --> 1:21:18,2200
Stop!

1675
1:21:18,2200 --> 1:21:20,2200
Stop!

1676
1:21:20,2200 --> 1:21:22,2200
Stop!

1677
1:21:22,2200 --> 1:21:25,2200
I'm so blind and look at you, Gwint.

1678
1:21:25,2200 --> 1:21:27,2200
Catching Gwint before you're...

1679
1:21:27,2200 --> 1:21:29,2200
...with hiremen.

1680
1:21:31,2200 --> 1:21:33,2200
Cameroos are assembling.

1681
1:21:33,2200 --> 1:21:35,2200
Finish the job, Robert.

1682
1:21:37,2200 --> 1:21:39,2200
Finish the job.

1683
1:21:39,2200 --> 1:21:41,2200
Yeah.

1684
1:21:41,2200 --> 1:21:43,2200
What?

1685
1:21:43,2200 --> 1:21:45,2200
They're not 13 years old.

1686
1:21:45,2200 --> 1:21:49,2200
Why do they need to kill me?

1687
1:21:49,2200 --> 1:21:53,2200
You need to do what I say, Robert.

1688
1:21:55,2200 --> 1:21:57,2200
Why?

1689
1:21:57,2200 --> 1:21:59,2200
Why?

1690
1:22:03,2200 --> 1:22:05,2200
Okay.

1691
1:22:05,2200 --> 1:22:07,2200
Read the book.

1692
1:22:07,2200 --> 1:22:09,2200
I know you plan to...

1693
1:22:09,2200 --> 1:22:11,2200
...take two hours.

1694
1:22:11,2200 --> 1:22:13,2200
We just finished.

1695
1:22:13,2200 --> 1:22:15,2200
Don't make me up and think there's nothing new.

1696
1:22:15,2200 --> 1:22:17,2200
I just hope they got regrouping.

1697
1:22:17,2200 --> 1:22:19,2200
This isn't even a team.

1698
1:22:19,2200 --> 1:22:21,2200
Of course not a team.

1699
1:22:21,2200 --> 1:22:23,2200
We are the Thunder Gods.

1700
1:22:23,2200 --> 1:22:25,2200
We need to go somewhere to discuss this.

1701
1:22:25,2200 --> 1:22:27,2200
That's what!

1702
1:22:27,2200 --> 1:22:29,2200
We are going to regroup and talk to people.

1703
1:22:29,2200 --> 1:22:31,2200
We are going to tell them that she had a car go.

1704
1:22:31,2200 --> 1:22:33,2200
Oh my god! Stop!

1705
1:22:33,2200 --> 1:22:35,2200
There is no...

1706
1:22:35,2200 --> 1:22:37,2200
...us, there is no we.

1707
1:22:37,2200 --> 1:22:39,2200
Bob changed into that thing.

1708
1:22:39,2200 --> 1:22:41,2200
And there is nothing any of you can do about it.

1709
1:22:41,2200 --> 1:22:43,2200
And what did you do exactly?

1710
1:22:43,2200 --> 1:22:47,2200
Because I think you can remember your house being way worse than that.

1711
1:22:47,2200 --> 1:22:49,2200
Yeah, yeah. I suck.

1712
1:22:49,2200 --> 1:22:51,2200
I'm terrible.

1713
1:22:51,2200 --> 1:22:52,2200
We're all terrible.

1714
1:22:52,2200 --> 1:22:56,2200
Hey, we are not a hero. You are not even a good person.

1715
1:22:56,2200 --> 1:22:58,2200
Damn, see?

1716
1:22:58,2200 --> 1:23:00,2200
I'm not your Amichka.

1717
1:23:00,2200 --> 1:23:04,2200
I haven't heard from you or seen you in a year.

1718
1:23:04,2200 --> 1:23:06,2200
You're going to go easy on him.

1719
1:23:06,2200 --> 1:23:08,2200
Also, you're nice now.

1720
1:23:08,2200 --> 1:23:10,2200
You know you're a piece of trash while personas are family.

1721
1:23:10,2200 --> 1:23:12,2200
Jesus.

1722
1:23:12,2200 --> 1:23:14,2200
We're all losers.

1723
1:23:14,2200 --> 1:23:16,2200
And we lost.

1724
1:23:22,2200 --> 1:23:24,2200
You're not alone.

1725
1:23:24,2200 --> 1:23:26,2200
You're not alone.

1726
1:23:26,2200 --> 1:23:30,2200
It needs to be we have a collaboration.

1727
1:23:30,2200 --> 1:23:32,2200
The hair, for example.

1728
1:23:32,2200 --> 1:23:34,2200
Maybe I should have gotten more of a say.

1729
1:23:34,2200 --> 1:23:38,2200
Don't let those idiots get in their head. The blonde is great.

1730
1:23:38,2200 --> 1:23:40,2200
Are you sure? Yeah, I don't know. I thought I liked it.

1731
1:23:40,2200 --> 1:23:42,2200
No, I'm not so sure. It's enough about the hair.

1732
1:23:42,2200 --> 1:23:44,2200
Well, it's not just about the hair.

1733
1:23:44,2200 --> 1:23:46,2200
Well, you keep talking about the hair.

1734
1:23:46,2200 --> 1:23:48,2200
No, it's everything.

1735
1:23:48,2200 --> 1:23:50,2200
My suit, my name, my missions.

1736
1:23:50,2200 --> 1:23:52,2200
What?

1737
1:23:52,2200 --> 1:23:56,2200
Why would a god take orders from anyone at all?

1738
1:23:56,2200 --> 1:24:00,2200
I think you're streaming around the word God at least later.

1739
1:24:00,2200 --> 1:24:02,2200
No, no, because you said I was all powerful and invincible.

1740
1:24:02,2200 --> 1:24:08,2200
I was stronger than a whole team of Avengers, which includes at least one god.

1741
1:24:12,2200 --> 1:24:16,2200
I'm sorry to say maybe you don't know what I am.

1742
1:24:16,2200 --> 1:24:18,2200
No, god.

1743
1:24:18,2200 --> 1:24:20,2200
I can't.

1744
1:24:20,2200 --> 1:24:22,2200
What I'm capable of.

1745
1:24:22,2200 --> 1:24:26,2200
Maybe I need to show you.

1746
1:24:26,2200 --> 1:24:30,2200
This is so irritating.

1747
1:24:36,2200 --> 1:24:38,2200
You're gonna turn on me.

1748
1:24:38,2200 --> 1:24:40,2200
Just like the rest of that.

1749
1:24:40,2200 --> 1:24:44,2200
I'm not afraid of you, Robert.

1750
1:24:44,2200 --> 1:24:48,2200
It's not, Robert. You know, you're afraid of me.

1751
1:24:48,2200 --> 1:24:50,2200
I'm afraid of you.

1752
1:25:02,2200 --> 1:25:04,2200
Good girl.

1753
1:25:04,2200 --> 1:25:06,2200
It came to your senses.

1754
1:25:08,2200 --> 1:25:10,2200
Can we have a healthy up?

1755
1:25:10,2200 --> 1:25:14,2200
I want to race.

1756
1:25:14,2200 --> 1:25:16,2200
Help me find.

1757
1:25:16,2200 --> 1:25:18,2200
Get me up on the bike.

1758
1:25:18,2200 --> 1:25:22,2200
And tell hope it's finally time to go lethal on these losers.

1759
1:25:22,2200 --> 1:25:24,2200
I'm sorry.

1760
1:25:38,2200 --> 1:25:40,2200
No, no.

1761
1:25:40,2200 --> 1:25:41,2200
We won't.

1762
1:25:41,2200 --> 1:25:42,2200
Go away.

1763
1:25:42,2200 --> 1:25:44,2200
No, I won't.

1764
1:25:44,2200 --> 1:25:46,2200
Well, then, chase me forever.

1765
1:25:46,2200 --> 1:25:48,2200
Okay, that's what Charlie does.

1766
1:25:48,2200 --> 1:25:50,2200
Oh my god. Stop.

1767
1:25:50,2200 --> 1:25:52,2200
I wouldn't hurt you.

1768
1:25:52,2200 --> 1:25:58,2200
I lost my sister again, but forever.

1769
1:25:58,2200 --> 1:26:00,2200
And you didn't feel it.

1770
1:26:00,2200 --> 1:26:02,2200
You didn't want to.

1771
1:26:02,2200 --> 1:26:04,2200
I'm sorry.

1772
1:26:04,2200 --> 1:26:08,2200
I don't know how to do this.

1773
1:26:08,2200 --> 1:26:12,2200
I'm not good at it.

1774
1:26:12,2200 --> 1:26:16,2200
I didn't think I wanted.

1775
1:26:16,2200 --> 1:26:20,2200
I didn't.

1776
1:26:20,2200 --> 1:26:24,2200
I see you now.

1777
1:26:24,2200 --> 1:26:28,2200
I'm late. One time.

1778
1:26:28,2200 --> 1:26:32,2200
I'm here now.

1779
1:26:32,2200 --> 1:26:40,2200
I don't have anything at all.

1780
1:26:40,2200 --> 1:26:44,2200
All I do is sit and look at my phone.

1781
1:26:44,2200 --> 1:26:48,2200
Don't think of all the terrible things that I'm done.

1782
1:26:48,2200 --> 1:26:50,2200
And then I want to work on the night drink.

1783
1:26:50,2200 --> 1:26:52,2200
And then I come home to no one.

1784
1:26:52,2200 --> 1:26:56,2200
And I said that I think about all the terrible things I've done

1785
1:26:56,2200 --> 1:26:58,2200
against.

1786
1:26:58,2200 --> 1:27:00,2200
Stop. Stop the old things that we regret.

1787
1:27:00,2200 --> 1:27:04,2200
No, but I have so many.

1788
1:27:04,2200 --> 1:27:08,2200
My first test at the Red Bull.

1789
1:27:08,2200 --> 1:27:12,2200
And if she was just a child, she would go slow.

1790
1:27:12,2200 --> 1:27:16,2200
So are you.

1791
1:27:16,2200 --> 1:27:18,2200
I know.

1792
1:27:18,2200 --> 1:27:20,2200
There were dark times.

1793
1:27:20,2200 --> 1:27:22,2200
Very, very dark times.

1794
1:27:22,2200 --> 1:27:28,2200
Before you were such a special vehicle to do notice.

1795
1:27:28,2200 --> 1:27:30,2200
You wanted to know.

1796
1:27:30,2200 --> 1:27:32,2200
You made it bright.

1797
1:27:32,2200 --> 1:27:36,2200
You felt what you were.

1798
1:27:36,2200 --> 1:27:38,2200
I don't remember you.

1799
1:27:38,2200 --> 1:27:40,2200
You were so kind.

1800
1:27:42,2200 --> 1:27:48,2200
You remember why you wanted to be going in town with soccer team?

1801
1:27:48,2200 --> 1:27:50,2200
It was.

1802
1:27:50,2200 --> 1:27:52,2200
So I didn't take the rallies much.

1803
1:27:52,2200 --> 1:27:54,2200
No, maybe that's it.

1804
1:27:54,2200 --> 1:27:56,2200
But you told me.

1805
1:27:56,2200 --> 1:28:00,2200
I want to be the one everywhere in general.

1806
1:28:00,2200 --> 1:28:02,2200
I'm just a million stately.

1807
1:28:02,2200 --> 1:28:06,2200
Actually, I'm still in.

1808
1:28:06,2200 --> 1:28:10,2200
I still see her.

1809
1:28:10,2200 --> 1:28:12,2200
Can you.

1810
1:28:12,2200 --> 1:28:14,2200
You stopped your alarm.

1811
1:28:14,2200 --> 1:28:16,2200
You look only at the bed.

1812
1:28:16,2200 --> 1:28:18,2200
When I look at you,

1813
1:28:18,2200 --> 1:28:22,2200
I don't see your mistakes.

1814
1:28:22,2200 --> 1:28:26,2200
That's what we need each other.

1815
1:28:26,2200 --> 1:28:32,2200
Can you imagine something good?

1816
1:28:40,2200 --> 1:28:42,2200
Well, yeah.

1817
1:28:42,2200 --> 1:28:44,2200
It's me up to the penthouse.

1818
1:28:44,2200 --> 1:28:46,2200
And you're saying,

1819
1:28:46,2200 --> 1:28:48,2200
well, there's no body.

1820
1:28:48,2200 --> 1:28:50,2200
What?

1821
1:28:50,2200 --> 1:28:52,2200
What?

1822
1:28:52,2200 --> 1:28:54,2200
What?

1823
1:28:54,2200 --> 1:28:56,2200
What?

1824
1:29:10,2200 --> 1:29:12,2200
I don't want to look at it.

1825
1:29:12,2200 --> 1:29:14,2200
I want guys.

1826
1:29:14,2200 --> 1:29:16,2200
You need to find me.

1827
1:29:16,2200 --> 1:29:18,2200
We have here.

1828
1:29:30,2200 --> 1:29:34,2200
How are you, singers?

1829
1:29:34,2200 --> 1:29:36,2200
I'm still.

1830
1:29:36,2200 --> 1:29:38,2200
Oh no.

1831
1:29:44,2200 --> 1:29:46,2200
I'm still.

1832
1:29:46,2200 --> 1:29:48,2200
I'm still.

1833
1:29:48,2200 --> 1:29:50,2200
I'm still.

1834
1:29:50,2200 --> 1:29:52,2200
I'm still.

1835
1:29:52,2200 --> 1:29:54,2200
I'm still.

1836
1:29:54,2200 --> 1:29:56,2200
I'm still.

1837
1:29:56,2200 --> 1:29:58,2200
I'm still.

1838
1:29:58,2200 --> 1:30:00,2200
I'm still.

1839
1:30:00,2200 --> 1:30:02,2200
I'm still.

1840
1:30:02,2200 --> 1:30:04,2200
I'm still.

1841
1:30:04,2200 --> 1:30:06,2200
I'm still.

1842
1:30:06,2200 --> 1:30:08,2200
I'm still.

1843
1:30:08,2200 --> 1:30:10,2200
I'm still.

1844
1:30:10,2200 --> 1:30:12,2200
I'm still.

1845
1:30:12,2200 --> 1:30:14,2200
I'm still.

1846
1:30:30,2200 --> 1:30:32,2200
My body is полification.

1847
1:30:32,2200 --> 1:30:34,2200
It's my aktivitive.

1848
1:30:36,2200 --> 1:30:38,2200
I'm still.

1849
1:30:38,2200 --> 1:30:40,2200
Boil water!

1850
1:30:40,2200 --> 1:30:41,7200
Boil water!

1851
1:30:41,7200 --> 1:30:43,7200
No, no, no!

1852
1:30:43,7200 --> 1:30:45,7200
No, no, no!

1853
1:30:45,7200 --> 1:30:46,7200
No!

1854
1:30:51,7200 --> 1:30:52,7200
No!

1855
1:31:11,7200 --> 1:31:13,7200
No!

1856
1:31:42,7200 --> 1:31:43,7200
No!

1857
1:31:51,7200 --> 1:31:53,7200
No!

1858
1:32:12,7200 --> 1:32:13,7200
No!

1859
1:32:21,7200 --> 1:32:23,7200
No!

1860
1:32:27,7200 --> 1:32:28,7200
No!

1861
1:32:29,7200 --> 1:32:30,7200
No!

1862
1:32:37,7200 --> 1:32:38,7200
No!

1863
1:32:39,7200 --> 1:32:41,7200
You're safe, Ditto One.

1864
1:32:51,7200 --> 1:32:53,7200
You all know the truth.

1865
1:32:59,7200 --> 1:33:02,7200
You can't tell where I'm at, Ditto One.

1866
1:33:02,7200 --> 1:33:06,7200
The late boss darkstack got superpowers every off the street.

1867
1:33:06,7200 --> 1:33:08,7200
Let's go, let's go!

1868
1:33:08,7200 --> 1:33:10,7200
Let's go!

1869
1:33:18,7200 --> 1:33:20,7200
Let's go!

1870
1:33:20,7200 --> 1:33:22,7200
Let's go!

1871
1:33:22,7200 --> 1:33:24,7200
Give me!

1872
1:33:24,7200 --> 1:33:26,7200
No!

1873
1:33:28,7200 --> 1:33:30,7200
No!

1874
1:33:41,7200 --> 1:33:43,7200
You're under what Ditto?

1875
1:33:46,7200 --> 1:33:48,7200
That's what you said.

1876
1:33:48,7200 --> 1:33:50,7200
You're all alone.

1877
1:33:50,7200 --> 1:33:52,7200
All of us.

1878
1:33:53,7200 --> 1:33:54,7200
What?!

1879
1:33:54,7200 --> 1:33:56,7200
You're the one!

1880
1:33:59,7200 --> 1:34:01,7200
No!

1881
1:34:07,7200 --> 1:34:09,7200
No, no, no, no!

1882
1:34:09,7200 --> 1:34:11,7200
No, no, no!

1883
1:34:11,7200 --> 1:34:13,7200
No!

1884
1:34:29,7200 --> 1:34:31,7200
No!

1885
1:34:34,7200 --> 1:34:35,7200
No!

1886
1:34:39,7200 --> 1:34:40,7200
No!

1887
1:34:45,7200 --> 1:34:47,7200
Where are you going?

1888
1:34:48,7200 --> 1:34:50,7200
You're not going to come to me.

1889
1:34:54,7200 --> 1:34:56,7200
Come here, you're stuck!

1890
1:34:59,7200 --> 1:35:01,7200
You're stuck!

1891
1:35:01,7200 --> 1:35:03,7200
Come here!

1892
1:35:18,7200 --> 1:35:20,7200
Where are you going?

1893
1:35:20,7200 --> 1:35:22,7200
Where are you going?

1894
1:35:22,7200 --> 1:35:24,7200
Where are you going?

1895
1:35:24,7200 --> 1:35:26,7200
Where are you going?

1896
1:35:26,7200 --> 1:35:28,7200
Where are you going?

1897
1:35:28,7200 --> 1:35:31,7200
No, no, no, no!

1898
1:35:31,7200 --> 1:35:33,7200
You're stuck!

1899
1:35:33,7200 --> 1:35:35,7200
No, no, no!

1900
1:35:35,7200 --> 1:35:37,7200
I'm too late.

1901
1:35:37,7200 --> 1:35:39,7200
My darling.

1902
1:35:46,7200 --> 1:35:48,7200
Where are you going?

1903
1:35:48,7200 --> 1:35:51,7200
I'm going to go to the wrong place.

1904
1:35:51,7200 --> 1:35:54,7200
I'm going to go to the wrong place.

1905
1:35:55,7200 --> 1:35:57,7200
I'm here, just me!

1906
1:35:58,7200 --> 1:36:00,7200
You lost him.

1907
1:36:18,7200 --> 1:36:20,7200
I'm here.

1908
1:36:20,7200 --> 1:36:22,7200
I'm going to punch him.

1909
1:36:22,7200 --> 1:36:29,7200
We don't have coin for this.

1910
1:36:52,7200 --> 1:36:59,7200
There you are.

1911
1:37:23,7200 --> 1:37:24,7200
It's all right.

1912
1:37:45,7200 --> 1:37:47,7200
I'm getting off.

1913
1:37:47,7200 --> 1:37:48,7200
You're good.

1914
1:37:49,7200 --> 1:37:51,7200
Is she too bad? She did it for a reason.

1915
1:37:51,7200 --> 1:37:53,7200
What if she's dead?

1916
1:37:53,7200 --> 1:37:55,7200
What if there's no coming back?

1917
1:37:55,7200 --> 1:37:56,7200
What if she's dead?

1918
1:37:56,7200 --> 1:37:57,7200
I didn't know that.

1919
1:37:57,7200 --> 1:38:00,7200
I don't know. I think she's ready with coin.

1920
1:38:00,7200 --> 1:38:05,7200
When I was back in the vault and I saw something and went somewhere I can't explain it.

1921
1:38:06,7200 --> 1:38:08,7200
What did you say?

1922
1:38:13,7200 --> 1:38:15,7200
Enough, Bob.

1923
1:38:17,7200 --> 1:38:19,7200
Enough.

1924
1:38:19,7200 --> 1:38:21,7200
You're in it?

1925
1:38:27,7200 --> 1:38:28,7200
Hey.

1926
1:38:28,7200 --> 1:38:30,7200
Hey.

1927
1:38:31,7200 --> 1:38:33,7200
I just want to talk, okay?

1928
1:38:35,7200 --> 1:38:36,7200
What about what?

1929
1:38:39,7200 --> 1:38:42,7200
Well, the stuff we spoke about in the gond.

1930
1:38:50,7200 --> 1:38:52,7200
Okay.

1931
1:38:55,7200 --> 1:38:56,7200
What's that?

1932
1:38:56,7200 --> 1:39:00,7200
I'm not much, you know.

1933
1:39:00,7200 --> 1:39:07,7200
I'm just watching New York disappear into a big maze of intercollected shamans.

1934
1:39:07,7200 --> 1:39:10,7200
You haven't seen anything crazy left out before.

1935
1:39:11,7200 --> 1:39:13,7200
I don't know what you want me to say.

1936
1:39:13,7200 --> 1:39:15,7200
Did she stop?

1937
1:39:15,7200 --> 1:39:17,7200
Oh, it's not me. Me.

1938
1:39:18,7200 --> 1:39:20,7200
It's it's it's bit.

1939
1:39:23,7200 --> 1:39:24,7200
Contoured.

1940
1:39:26,7200 --> 1:39:29,7200
I have these good days, you know.

1941
1:39:29,7200 --> 1:39:32,7200
Where I feel, I feel it's me.

1942
1:39:32,7200 --> 1:39:36,7200
But there are a lot of bad days.

1943
1:39:36,7200 --> 1:39:39,7200
I remember that nothing...

1944
1:39:40,7200 --> 1:39:43,7200
...and the match, you know.

1945
1:39:44,7200 --> 1:39:47,7200
It's all we're just gonna sit here and let it take all our...

1946
1:39:47,7200 --> 1:39:50,7200
I was not used to waiting yet.

1947
1:39:50,7200 --> 1:39:53,7200
At least I found a nice room.

1948
1:39:53,7200 --> 1:39:56,7200
The alley rooms are much worse.

1949
1:39:57,7200 --> 1:40:00,7200
It is nice and quiet here, yeah?

1950
1:40:02,7200 --> 1:40:05,7200
I don't like them, they're not the opposite.

1951
1:40:05,7200 --> 1:40:07,7200
Hey, you!

1952
1:40:07,7200 --> 1:40:10,7200
I just... I said it. It's tall. It's not true.

1953
1:40:10,7200 --> 1:40:12,7200
We have to be stuck.

1954
1:40:12,7200 --> 1:40:13,7200
What?

1955
1:40:13,7200 --> 1:40:15,7200
Oh, it's not me.

1956
1:40:15,7200 --> 1:40:16,7200
But you can stop.

1957
1:40:16,7200 --> 1:40:19,7200
You're a lonely thing to do.

1958
1:40:19,7200 --> 1:40:21,7200
You're a kid, Worst.

1959
1:40:21,7200 --> 1:40:24,7200
You always make it worse.

1960
1:40:26,7200 --> 1:40:28,7200
I'm sorry.

1961
1:40:29,7200 --> 1:40:31,7200
That's funny.

1962
1:40:41,7200 --> 1:40:43,7200
I'm sorry.

1963
1:40:58,7200 --> 1:41:01,7200
What I said to you before was wrong, but...

1964
1:41:01,7200 --> 1:41:04,7200
...you can't stop it down.

1965
1:41:04,7200 --> 1:41:07,7200
You can't hold it then, all alone.

1966
1:41:07,7200 --> 1:41:09,7200
No one can.

1967
1:41:10,7200 --> 1:41:14,7200
We have to let it out. We have to spend time together.

1968
1:41:15,7200 --> 1:41:18,7200
And even if it doesn't make the emptiness go away,

1969
1:41:18,7200 --> 1:41:22,7200
I'm in promise you it will feel like there.

1970
1:41:22,7200 --> 1:41:25,7200
I know.

1971
1:41:28,7200 --> 1:41:31,7200
Because it already has for me.

1972
1:41:35,7200 --> 1:41:38,7200
I can't wait to weigh out on the earth again.

1973
1:41:40,7200 --> 1:41:43,7200
Will you try and leave here with me?

1974
1:41:49,7200 --> 1:41:50,7200
Okay.

1975
1:41:50,7200 --> 1:41:52,7200
Okay.

1976
1:42:07,7200 --> 1:42:09,7200
I'm slain in the forest!

1977
1:42:11,7200 --> 1:42:13,7200
Let me try it!

1978
1:42:20,7200 --> 1:42:23,7200
I'm trying to get you through the gate.

1979
1:42:23,7200 --> 1:42:25,7200
I'm okay here.

1980
1:42:25,7200 --> 1:42:27,7200
I'm not going to get worse.

1981
1:42:41,7200 --> 1:42:43,7200
Where's your gun?

1982
1:42:47,7200 --> 1:42:49,7200
Let her go.

1983
1:42:53,7200 --> 1:42:55,7200
Okay, Chris.

1984
1:42:56,7200 --> 1:42:58,7200
What did you say? Are you okay?

1985
1:42:58,7200 --> 1:43:01,7200
Oh, I'm fine. I haven't worked out a song. I'm fine.

1986
1:43:01,7200 --> 1:43:05,7200
Yeah, the space is messed up. We're here together.

1987
1:43:05,7200 --> 1:43:08,7200
That's what I'm trying to say.

1988
1:43:09,7200 --> 1:43:12,7200
Thank you, guys. Really?

1989
1:43:12,7200 --> 1:43:16,7200
Of course. We are Shane, Celine, her electronic tunnage.

1990
1:43:16,7200 --> 1:43:18,7200
It's not.

1991
1:43:18,7200 --> 1:43:21,7200
How do we do that?

1992
1:43:24,7200 --> 1:43:29,7200
As far as I know, it's just endless rooms.

1993
1:43:29,7200 --> 1:43:34,7200
Wait, you said that this was the nicest room you found in the other way, right?

1994
1:43:34,7200 --> 1:43:36,7200
Yeah.

1995
1:43:37,7200 --> 1:43:40,7200
Okay, well, show us the worst.

1996
1:43:41,7200 --> 1:43:43,7200
Where's the other way?

1997
1:43:43,7200 --> 1:43:46,7200
Where's the other way?

1998
1:43:54,7200 --> 1:43:57,7200
This is my fault.

1999
1:43:57,7200 --> 1:44:00,7200
Come here now.

2000
1:44:00,7200 --> 1:44:10,1800
city

2001
1:44:10,1800 --> 1:44:27,0800
four

2002
1:44:27,0800 --> 1:44:30,7800
You need to sign one more time.

2003
1:44:30,7800 --> 1:44:31,7800
I'll sign one more time.

2004
1:44:31,7800 --> 1:44:33,2800
I'll sign one more time.

2005
1:44:36,7800 --> 1:44:37,7800
It's mine!

2006
1:44:37,7800 --> 1:44:39,2800
I'll sign one more time.

2007
1:44:54,2800 --> 1:44:55,7800
I've been here before.

2008
1:44:57,0800 --> 1:44:59,0800
I was very sorry.

2009
1:44:59,0800 --> 1:45:02,0800
I was wrong in my own Southeast Asia.

2010
1:45:02,0800 --> 1:45:04,0800
I thought I'd figure something out.

2011
1:45:04,0800 --> 1:45:06,0800
I missed my more drugs.

2012
1:45:08,0800 --> 1:45:10,0800
And there's this guy.

2013
1:45:10,0800 --> 1:45:13,0800
He started talking to me about a...

2014
1:45:13,0800 --> 1:45:15,0800
a medical study.

2015
1:45:15,0800 --> 1:45:18,0800
A trial drug that can make me stronger.

2016
1:45:18,0800 --> 1:45:20,0800
I felt like a miracle.

2017
1:45:22,0800 --> 1:45:26,0800
If I would get to show everyone that I was more...

2018
1:45:27,0800 --> 1:45:29,0800
and I was...

2019
1:45:30,0800 --> 1:45:32,0800
something...

2020
1:45:32,0800 --> 1:45:35,0800
that would hurt me when I reached.

2021
1:45:40,0800 --> 1:45:42,0800
Whilst she inputting by...

2022
1:45:42,0800 --> 1:45:46,0800
the sickling you could be anything more than you.

2023
1:45:46,0800 --> 1:45:48,0800
Nothing.

2024
1:45:49,0800 --> 1:45:51,0800
Or a lignal.

2025
1:45:57,0800 --> 1:45:59,0800
No.

2026
1:46:16,0800 --> 1:46:18,0800
Stop.

2027
1:46:18,0800 --> 1:46:21,0800
I can go.

2028
1:46:21,0800 --> 1:46:25,0800
Are you using a big ear about you?

2029
1:46:26,0800 --> 1:46:28,0800
You don't matter.

2030
1:46:28,0800 --> 1:46:30,0800
Dang.

2031
1:46:30,0800 --> 1:46:32,0800
That's not true!

2032
1:46:34,0800 --> 1:46:36,0800
Don't do her.

2033
1:46:37,0800 --> 1:46:40,0800
I would do you right now.

2034
1:46:48,0800 --> 1:46:51,0800
I'm stronger than you.

Some savior.

2038
1:47:03,0800 --> 1:47:06,0800
Can you take yourself?

2039
1:47:06,0800 --> 1:47:08,0800
No.

2040
1:47:08,0800 --> 1:47:11,0800
We all know that.

2041
1:47:11,0800 --> 1:47:14,0800
We have to go.

2042
1:47:14,0800 --> 1:47:16,0800

I'm here.

2054
1:48:56,0800 --> 1:48:59,0800
We will always be just ones.

Sorry, I'm gonna come to school tomorrow.

Great. For years, I have been working secretly to develop a new age of protection.

2086
1:52:17,9600 --> 1:52:26,9600
Today, the citizens of the United States needed that protection and thanks to my hard work, they got it.

2087
1:52:26,9600 --> 1:52:32,9600
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the new Avengers.

How do we solve the worries?

There's a toss that all we play is four people fighting on this.

2135
1:55:23,9600 --> 1:55:25,9600

God is gonna stop us now.

2164
1:56:57,9600 --> 1:57:03,9600
And this world of love will still have each other.

2165
1:57:03,9600 --> 1:57:05,9600
No, it's gonna stop us.

2166
1:57:05,9600 --> 1:57:09,9600

2:02:37,9600 --> 2:02:39,9600
I'm going to go to the next room.

2332
2:02:39,9600 --> 2:02:41,9600
The system went straight.

2333
2:02:41,9600 --> 2:02:43,9600
It went straight.

2334
2:02:43,9600 --> 2:02:45,9600
It went.

2335
2:02:45,9600 --> 2:02:47,9600
It went.

2336
2:02:47,9600 --> 2:02:49,9600
The system got a bank in front of the corner

2337
2:02:49,9600 --> 2:02:51,9600
and then nowhere...

2338
2:02:51,9600 --> 2:02:53,9600
It went.

2339
2:02:53,9600 --> 2:02:55,9600
Now here's the picture on the x.

2340
2:02:55,9600 --> 2:02:57,9600
We see the formula.

2341
2:02:57,9600 --> 2:02:59,9600
Now here's the formula.

2342
2:02:59,9600 --> 2:03:01,9600
Look!

2343
2:03:01,9600 --> 2:03:03,9600
Alright!

2344
2:03:03,9600 --> 2:03:05,9600
Let's go to Go In.

2345
2:03:05,9600 --> 2:03:07,9600
Go in.

2346
2:03:07,9600 --> 2:03:09,9600
They don't think that it's us.

2347
2:03:09,9600 --> 2:03:11,4600
Won't you go to talk to him?

2348
2:03:11,4600 --> 2:03:12,4600
How are you doing?

2349
2:03:12,4600 --> 2:03:13,4600
Ed?

2350
2:03:13,4600 --> 2:03:14,4600
What poor of me.

2351
2:03:14,4600 --> 2:03:15,9600
I don't know what any of these buttons do.

2352
2:03:15,9600 --> 2:03:17,4600
I'm pretty well done, Mark and you ever.

2353
2:03:17,4600 --> 2:03:18,4600
You know his file?

2354
2:03:18,4600 --> 2:03:19,9600
We're talking right up the name.

2355
2:03:19,9600 --> 2:03:20,9600
To be?

2356
2:03:20,9600 --> 2:03:22,4600
We're losing credibility.

2357
2:03:22,4600 --> 2:03:24,4600
Maybe we have very little to begin with.

2358
2:03:24,4600 --> 2:03:26,4600
And now there's a huge space crisis

2359
2:03:26,4600 --> 2:03:27,9600
and no one's telling us about it.

2360
2:03:27,9600 --> 2:03:28,9600
We're running out of space.

2361
2:03:28,9600 --> 2:03:29,9600
Already it's impossible.

2362
2:03:29,9600 --> 2:03:32,4600
This building is enormous.

2363
2:03:33,4600 --> 2:03:34,4600
Okay?

2364
2:03:34,4600 --> 2:03:35,4600
What?

2365
2:03:35,4600 --> 2:03:36,4600
Outer space.

2366
2:03:36,4600 --> 2:03:37,4600
Outer space.

2367
2:03:38,4600 --> 2:03:39,9600
Run is run analysis.

2368
2:03:39,9600 --> 2:03:40,9600
I want to pull the report.

2369
2:03:40,9600 --> 2:03:42,9600
I think it's not an elephant.

2370
2:03:42,9600 --> 2:03:44,9600
Hello, Ted.

2371
2:03:44,9600 --> 2:03:46,9600
How are you?

2372
2:03:46,9600 --> 2:03:48,9600
I heard about Sam Wilson.

2373
2:03:48,9600 --> 2:03:49,9600
He's dumb.

2374
2:03:49,9600 --> 2:03:50,9600
I'm a religious man.

2375
2:03:50,9600 --> 2:03:51,9600
I'm smart.

2376
2:03:51,9600 --> 2:03:52,9600
I'm smart man.

2377
2:03:52,9600 --> 2:03:53,9600
I have smart solve.

2378
2:03:53,9600 --> 2:03:55,9600
A van.

2379
2:03:55,9600 --> 2:03:56,9600
A jazz.

2380
2:03:56,9600 --> 2:03:59,9600
A van.

2381
2:03:59,9600 --> 2:04:02,9600
With his Z, there's no copyright.

2382
2:04:02,9600 --> 2:04:03,9600
No.

2383
2:04:03,9600 --> 2:04:04,9600
To solve.

2384
2:04:04,9600 --> 2:04:07,9600
I want to tell you like a little bottom of, uh,

2385
2:04:07,9600 --> 2:04:08,9600
maybe Sue.

2386
2:04:08,9600 --> 2:04:11,9600
You want to say a little bit?

2387
2:04:11,9600 --> 2:04:12,9600
I don't want to touch on you.

2388
2:04:12,9600 --> 2:04:14,9600
Maybe Sue, but I have one for you.

2389
2:04:14,9600 --> 2:04:15,9600
I don't want to.

2390
2:04:15,9600 --> 2:04:16,9600
I got one for you.

2391
2:04:16,9600 --> 2:04:17,9600
I got you one.

2392
2:04:17,9600 --> 2:04:18,9600
I got you one.

2393
2:04:18,9600 --> 2:04:21,9600
And for you Bob in the corner hiding,

2394
2:04:21,9600 --> 2:04:23,9600
but then he buried the book.

2395
2:04:23,9600 --> 2:04:29,9600
We all matching all parts of super team.

2396
2:04:29,9600 --> 2:04:31,9600
This one has my sound.

2397
2:04:31,9600 --> 2:04:33,9600
She got a sound like a bitch.

2398
2:04:34,9600 --> 2:04:36,9600
Get a satellite image.

2399
2:04:36,9600 --> 2:04:39,9600
And fire out the jets.

2400
2:04:39,9600 --> 2:04:41,9600
We wouldn't need the fire out the jet if we had a,

2401
2:04:41,9600 --> 2:04:42,9600
a century.

2402
2:04:42,9600 --> 2:04:43,9600
A good fly.

2403
2:04:43,9600 --> 2:04:44,9600
I got sorry.

2404
2:04:44,9600 --> 2:04:45,9600
Nice.

2405
2:04:45,9600 --> 2:04:46,9600
Sorry guys.

2406
2:04:46,9600 --> 2:04:49,9600
Can't be the century without the, you know,

2407
2:04:49,9600 --> 2:04:50,9600
other side.

2408
2:04:50,9600 --> 2:04:53,9600
I did the dishes though.

2409
2:04:53,9600 --> 2:04:54,9600
What are we going to do?

2410
2:04:54,9600 --> 2:04:58,9600
Just like ride Bob into the sky.

2411
2:04:58,9600 --> 2:04:59,9600
I was.

2412
2:04:59,9600 --> 2:05:00,9600
I was.

2413
2:05:00,9600 --> 2:05:04,9600
I was.

2414
2:05:04,9600 --> 2:05:07,9600
This is why we're inventors of busy.

2415
2:05:07,9600 --> 2:05:13,9600
Extra dimensional ship entering atmosphere.

2416
2:05:13,9600 --> 2:05:14,9600
Extra dimensional, but that.

2417
2:05:14,9600 --> 2:05:16,9600
Cool.

2418
2:05:16,9600 --> 2:05:23,9600
Cool, shit.

2419
2:05:23,9600 --> 2:05:24,5400
